Your reckless folly has lost the Recycler, along with any hope of escaping this hellish planet. Over the next few days, you and your crew grow weak from biometal poisoning, and you stumble into the jaws of a carnivorous plant.  

By the end of a week, the Cerberi easily capture your surviving crew and torture them into revealing the location of Earth. A month later, Earth's defenses are overwhelmed by a massive Hadean/Cerberi attack.

The flame of human civilization is snuffed out and our race is hunted to extinction, all as a result of your blundering incompetence.
