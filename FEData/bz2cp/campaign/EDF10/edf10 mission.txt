player has just got here and destroyed the portal from whence they came. A hadean dropship takes off.

edf10a(rodriquez) "I guess they were expecting someone else, better start setting up base commander"

edf10b(rodriquez) "Cerberi seem to be gathering off the island intercept them"

player sent to investigate an incoming attack. The 5th column shows up to thwart it.

edf10c(hardin) " i don't know why those hadeans are attacking the cerberi. Take a chance and help them out"

player follows hadean commander

edf10d(hadean commander) "We are of the 5th column. We believe our brethren to be misguided in their alliance with the cerberi. We cannot directly aid you at this time. It is difficult to spill the blood of our brothers. We still need biometal, however. There is a scrapyard on a nearby island. You may use these portals freely. We may have some information for you later if you agree to share it(biometal). 

BM the edf10d.wav cannot last over 34 seconds. because hardin speaks riight after. you will have to change that wait if it goes over.

edf10e(hardin) "Commander, if what these guys is saying is true we may have a new ally. we can get enough scrap from this scrapyard to fix the storm petrel and give the 5th column. Get some scavs deployed there pronto. 

      Once two scavs are deployed the 5th column reveals that shultz is here.

edf10f(hardin) "The 5th column says there is a human prisoner here on this world. It has to be shultz. Get a rescue team there immediately.

The player has to rescue shultz from the cerberi. 

edf10z(shultz) "Well about damn time! No food no water and I think they were about to do some anal probes on me."

edf10g(hardin) "The interplanetary portal is inside  a hadean base. The 5th column commander reccommends probing the defenses first. There are beam traps everywhere. But there has to be a path with none.

Once the hadean recy has been destroyed. the mission is over.
