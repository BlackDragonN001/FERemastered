     The VENGEANCE Task Force barely escaped the encircling Hadean army on Spartacus, but we may have only delayed the inevitable. Our discovery of the StarPortal had seemed like an incredible stroke of luck, a nearly miraculous rescue from the jaws of a deadly Hadean trap.  
     But that "miracle" turned into a curse. We all understand why that particular Portal was left unguarded, why the Hadeans had ignored such a promising escape.  
     The StarPortal led to a planet the Hadeans had aptly named "Miasma." Satan himself could hardly have devised a more hellish landscape, a seething maelstrom of smoke and heat, boiling lava and stagnant poisons, teeming with semi-intelligent plant life intent on devouring any scrap of flesh or biometal that strayed too close.  
     Biometal--it was the only possible explanation for the Hadeans building a StarPortal aimed at the furious planet of Miasma.  The world is rife with the precious material, its surface pocked and blistered with molten biometal, its waters poisoned with heavy metal toxins, the very air itself polluted with a fine mist of oxidized scrap. If planets are truly alive and sentient, as some would have us believe, then Miasma is a homicidal maniac, a serial killer bent on murdering its victims with slow and dreadful torture.
     Most of us are sick already, weakened from intense heat and dehydration, and exposure to the deadly toxins. A lot of the guys figure we should have stayed on Spartacus and fought it out; death in battle would have been mercifully quick, even glorious. Others figure maybe we should have just given up, taken our chances and hoped for mercy from the Hadeans.  One thing's certain: it couldn't have turned out any worse.  
     There's no glory to be had on Miasma--and not a shred of mercy.
