The VENGEANCE has been destroyed.  Without your help, Schultz is recaptured on Tranquility; the Cerberi and Hadeans siphon his mind and memory for details about Earth's defenses.  The Hadean/Cerberi victory is swift and brutal because the EDF hasn't a single Recycler left to defend our world.

Your name lives in infamy and all humanity curses your memory with its dying gasp. The last traces of human civilization are expunged from the surface of Earth just nine days after the Hadean fleet enters orbit.
