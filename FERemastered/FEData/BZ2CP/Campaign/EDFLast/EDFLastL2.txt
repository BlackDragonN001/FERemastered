PERSONAL LOG
Colonel Joseph Corber, EDF
Date: 2.17.2010

   It's all over.  The PEACEMAKER is gone.
   The Nexus has cloned itself many times over, and its progeny have been producing units at a prodigious rate. Attack waves of Typhons, Tyrants, and Claws have spread across the entire Northern Hemisphere. New York, London and Moscow have already fallen; Washington D.C. and the EDF headquarters in Luxemburg are still holding out but they won't last much longer. The Nexus units have repelled all conventional attacks, and the StarDestroyer has shot down any nuclear missiles aimed at them. Typhons have inflicted heavy losses on Sino-Russian, Euro, and American air forces.
   The nearest Recycler is still fifteen hours away. By the time it reaches Earth, the entire planet will probably be under Imperial control. My command is scattered, and the few remaining men grumble among themselves and scowl at me like the whole disaster is my fault.
   And I couldn't agree with them more.
