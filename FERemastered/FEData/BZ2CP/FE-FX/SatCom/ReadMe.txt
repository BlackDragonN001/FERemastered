SATELLITE COMMAND UNIT

Config name : satcom

Notes: The original idea was to have a slow, tracked unit. Not wanting to stress the modellers even
more, I used an APC instead. The effect should be that of the unit 'painting' the target for the
satellite. Looks real, but it's a dummy - if the APC can't paint the target for whatever reason,
it'll still get nuked...
This is only an idea for how a 'satellite effect' could be featured in the game. There is, of course,
no satellite up there - in the end it's just a tank firing a tweaked weapon, and will behave as such...
