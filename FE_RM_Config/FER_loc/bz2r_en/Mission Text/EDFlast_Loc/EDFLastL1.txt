Verification code:  82415-650.PW1


This communication represents official notice of a summary execution to take place immediately upon your arrival at EDF Headquarters Terra (Luxemburg). The charges and specifications for this procedure include but are not limited to:

1) Dereliction of duty for your failure to follow a direct order to investigate Imperial Hadean activity.

2) Cowardice in the face of the enemy, as evidenced by the above inaction.

3) Gross Insubordination, and Conduct Unbecoming an Officer, for your unwillingness to hand your vehicle over to authorities and your actions in resisting arrest by the Military Police.


Your sentence, as defined by the Emergency Authorization Act (EWT09, Item 9) is as follows:

1) Immediate separation from EDF, without pay, benefits, or other rights and privileges commensurate with rank (Dishonorable Discharge),

	AND

2) Death by firing squad.


A trial will NOT be convened, due to the current military situation, to which you have contributed in no small part. It is recommended that you wear your full dress uniform for the event, as burial will immediately follow execution.

Effective immediately, you are confined to quarters.
