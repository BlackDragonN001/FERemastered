     It's three days since we abandoned our first base on Miasma. Windex calls it an "orderly retreat," but we're really running for our lives--skulking and hiding from those deadly black machines. They're part of an elite new Hadean force: amazingly powerful vehicles driven by skilled and fearless pilots. 
     We've bagged a few tanks but the pilots never seem to eject. Captain Eisenstein has checked the wreckage and found some extremely sophisticated computers, "fly-by-wire" systems that need very little pilot input. We can't decipher the programming, but we have learned the Hadean term for their bloodthirsty minions: they're known as "Cerberi," named after the mythical Hounds of Hell. It suits them perfectly.
     Right now, we've got even bigger problems than the Cerberi: three days of running has sapped our energy, exhausted our determination and dulled our fighting edge. Without even a temporary camp, we've had to live inside our tanks, dozing at the controls, choking down cold MRE's that taste just like their cardboard wrappers, and broiling in the heat as we sip our last few ounces of fresh water.
     We can't last much longer without rest and repairs. Luckily, our scouts spotted a decent base location just a few klicks southwest. If we can reach it, we just might have a chance...as long as the Hounds of Hell don't catch us first.
