A detailed briefing will be available for your review during the trip to Mercury. Keep your nose clean on this voyage, because your unit leader is aboard and she's in a nasty mood. Major Carla Wyndt-Essex suspects you and Schultz of setting those white rats loose in the mess hall yesterday. One of them got into the Service Bay and chewed through the starter wires of her Thunderbolt.

Scuttlebutt has it that "Major Windex" is a neat freak--far more concerned with cleaning skills than fighting drills. She just put Schultz on report for faded brass and a crooked trouser crease, but you're certain your best friend will win in the end. A good pilot and a great practical joker, Jay Schultz has been at your side since Officer Candidate School. As your wingman, he'll be just as good at clearing fighters from your tail as he is at drawing the Major's wrath. 

Not that there's likely to be any real fighting. You're getting hazard pay, but everyone's expecting a soft mission--another PR campaign to justify the EDF's existence.

The way it's looking, the biggest danger you and Jay will face is getting polished to death by Major Windex.
