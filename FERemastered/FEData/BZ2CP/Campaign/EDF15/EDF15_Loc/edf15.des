   The Imperial fleet is almost
ready to depart Facility, but
we are still unsure about their
final target. Rebel forces
report that a nearby tunnel 
may lead to the Hadean Fleet's
Wormhole Control Center here
on the planet's surface. We must
find that tunnel and reach the 
Control Center to track the fleet.
   We'll have to hurry, though--
their scouts are hot on our trail!
