   The PEACEMAKER arrived safely
but your convoy was attacked on
its way through the tunnels. The
journey has taken two full days.
   Even worse, rebel spies have
finally discovered the Imperial
Fleet's plans: they will exit
the Wormhole near Core and then
attack Earth itself. The fleet is 
on its final approach. You must 
seize the Controller and stop 
them, before it's too late!
