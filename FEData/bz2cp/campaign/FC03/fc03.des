   Our destruction of the Cerberi
Assembler has reduced their
production rate, but the Ark II
was torpedoed and her ionjet
propulsor was heavily damaged.
   The Ark and her passengers are
hidden some distance away, but
the Propulsor was hoverlifted to
a secret repair yard nearby. We
must help deliver a shipment of
rare neohydrium catalyser rods
vital to the Ark's final repairs.
