Colonel Corber:

I am pleased and honored to inform you that the United Earth Senate today has voted to award you the coveted Earth Cross of Honor, our civilization's highest military commendation, for your leadership, gallantry, and courage under fire in the recent police action against the Hadean Imperial aggressors. As is customary, the Earth Cross will be accompanied by lifetime assignment to the rank of General in the Senatorial Honor Guard, a ceremonial post which nonetheless carries with it an annual salary of one million gelden. 

The commendation and promotion are naturally contingent upon your signing the enclosed confidentiality agreement regarding the police action, especially with regard to the preparedness of Earth's space combat forces. Now that the Hadean Emperor has signed a peace treaty and all alien forces have retreated to Labyrinth, I'm sure you will agree that there is no point in unduly alarming the public about a nonexistent threat. Secrecy and confidentiality are key to our planetary security, and I have no doubt that you will do your duty in agreeing to this simple condition.

Again, congratulations again on your heroism and gallantry, General Corber!


Respectfully,

Secretary-General Yohira Ganjes, United Earth Senate, Luxemburg
(RetinalSigned)

RE:  Confidentiality Agreement
Verification code:  WAIVED

Secretary-General Ganjes:

Although I would be honored to receive the Earth Cross and the accompanying appointment to the Senatorial Honor Guard, I cannot in due conscience agree to the secrecy conditions you specified in the "confidentiality agreement." Like General Hardin, I am of the firm opinion that our space defenses were woefully inadequate prior to the Hadean War. Furthermore, I am certain that our planet's salvation was the result of General Hardin's persistence and tenacity, and his "illegal" use of biometal weapons which had been outlawed by your Administration. Your attempts to blackball General Hardin and lay the blame for the Hadean crisis at his doorstep are wanton slurs on the honor of one of the best military leaders in human history.

I have no intention of participating in a cover-up of the events leading up to the Hadean War, and my personal log has already been submitted to the Special Investigations subcommittee for review. I am certain that General Hardin will be exonerated when the truth is revealed, and that blame for the Hadean invasion will ultimately rest where it belongs: with your Administration.

Respecfully,

Colonel Joseph Corber, Commander 12th SPECOP, Earth Defense Force

Colonel Corber:

I regret to inform you of a clerical error which occurred in the Secretary-General's office today. Mr. Ganjes had been misinformed regarding your awards and commendations. You will not be receiving the Earth Cross of Honor or the General's post in the Senatorial Honor Guard.

Instead, the award you were intended to receive was actually the Brass Triad, awarded to all EDF officers who complete a full year of service without any absences due to injury or illness.

Congratulations on an absence-free year!

Respectfully,

Rafael Montague III
