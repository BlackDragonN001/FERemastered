PERSONAL LOG
Colonel Joseph Corber, EDF
Date: 2.07.2007

   I can't believe I entered the wrong password. I knew the numbers--they're forever engraved upon my mind--but Eisenstein says I punched in the wrong code. All I know is that an alarm klaxon sounded and the Wormhole Controller self-destructed. Apparently the Imperials have switched to an orbiting Controller node, so we'll never be able to gain access.
   The men all think I'm an idiot for entering the wrong code, and I don't blame them. It's my fault that we're doomed to die here on this planet, helpless to save Earth from the Imperial assault.
   All because I was careless, because I punched the wrong numbers even though I knew the proper code. The men are right--I *am* an idiot.
