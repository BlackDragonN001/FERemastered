Notes on ranges:

- Usable global ivars are network.session.ivar0
.. network.session.ivar127.  BZ2 has used ivars 0-34 & 63. Modders
should consider using ivars starting at the top of the range (ivar127,
ivar126, ivar125, ...) to avoid collisions.

- Usable global svars are network.session.svar0
.. network.session.svar31. As above, mods should start from the top of
the range and work down.

- After the global ivar/svars, there are 16 ivars per client (the
civar0..civar15) and 8 svars per client (csvar0..csvar7). These are
mapped into the global list automatically by the engine, so that the
first player's civars are in network.session.ivar128
.. network.session.ivar143, second player's civars start at
network.session.ivar144, and so forth. However, reading these directly
is discouraged, because the number of global ivar/svars may change at
any time.


ivars: [32-bit unsigneds]

0: Kill Limit (0 for unlimited)

1: Time Limit (0 for unlimited)

2: Player Limit

3: Teamplay. 1=On 0=off

4: Bitfields saying which vehicles are selectable

5: 0=All, DM=1, Strat=2, all other values undefined (used in filtering
   out games by type). MPI is technically 3, but any Strat w/ Teamplay
   (ivar3=1), w/ only one team (ivar12=1) will be listed as that. I'd
   recommend leaving ivar5=2 for MPI to avoid any quirks in the code.

6: Bitfields II for selectable vehicles out of MPVehicles.txt [Unimplemented so far]

7: Strat & MPI: starting vehicles bitfield mask, for selecting out of
   StratStarting.txt . Strat forces this value to be either 0 or 3
   (nothing or 2 turrets). MPI uses all the bits.

7: Deathmatch01: Used to set the game type. 0 = normal; 1 = KOTH;
2 = CTF 3=Loot, 4=[RESERVED], 5 = Race (respawn as person), 6= Race
(respawn in craft), 7= Normal but vehicle-only combat

8: Sync Join. 1=on, 0=off

9: Unit Limit (0 for unlimited). In DM/Race, this is the # of laps.
In DM/non-race, this is the # of AI bots (units) sent to harass everyone.

10: Nonblocking-joins. If 0 (default), everyone will pause on a join
    until movepackets from that player come in. If non-0, the
    'thundering herd' approach is taken-- everyone keeps going,
    bandwidth usage be damned. [I.e. modem-crushing for >4 players]

11: Teamplay locked. 1=on, 0=off

12: 0: Allow 2 teams. 1: 1 team only. 

13: MPInstant only, CPU team race. Default is 105 (ascii for 'i') =
isdf, 102 (ascii for 'f') = scion, other races as appropriate.  [See
websites like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII or
http://www.asciitable.com/ for a table converting from the character
glyph to decimal]

13: DM only: # of seconds after a respawn for a spawn kill (0=off, 15=
default).

14: Score (points) for killing AI craft. Negative points are awarded
for killing own/ally AI craft. Default: 0 for strat, 1 for DM/MPI

15: If 1, +1 kill is awarded for killing an enemy AI unit (and -1 kill
for killing ally), No change to kills if this ivar is 0. Default: 0
for strat, 1 for DM/MPI

16: Strat/MPI: If 1, Strat/MPI players respawn with sniper rifle. Default 0.

16: DM: if 1, humans vs bots is the mode.

17: Strat/MPI AI skill level for human turrets in Strat (0..3). Default 3.

18: AI skill level for all human other units in Strat. Default 3.

19: DM: if 1, 1-shot-kill mode is on. Default 0.

20: Multiworld frequency (MWF), from server.

21: AI skill level for CPU turrets in MPI (0..3). Default 3.

22: AI skill level for all other CPU units in MPI. Default 3.

23: MPI Level of scrap cheat for humans in MPI (0..3). Default 0

23: DM: if 1, "rabbit" mode (everyone attacks the person who's "it"

23: Strat: Not used

24: (MPI) Level of scrap cheat for CPU in MPI (0..3). Default 2.

25: DM: If 1, respawn in ship, and can't eject/hop out.

25: MPI: if 1, then AI team's race (from ivar13) is locked, and can't
be changed.

25: Strat: minutes of recycler invulnerability. Default 0.

26: DM: Damage multiplier, divided by 10. Thus, if ivar26 is 10, the
damage mult is 100% (unchanged). If 20, 200% (double-normal), etc.
Defaults to 10 in DM, 0 other gametypes.

26: MPI: Time (in seconds) before the AIPs are kicked out of the
*0.aip stage, and into the 1/3 stage. A value of 0 is treated as the
default of 180 seconds. If this value is less than 0, it'll never
trigger.

27: (DM) Number of animals in the map. Default 0. Max is 8.

28: (All) Lifespan of a non-player pilot in MP. This value is the
number of seconds an AI pilot that ejected/hopped out of a craft has
in MP is allowed to live before they get killed. [Human players,
soldiers from APCs aren't subject to this.] Values <= 0 are treated as
unlimited. Default if unspecified is 120 (2 minutes). This is
something done by the exe, not the DLL.

29: (All) Flag as whether the server disables the TLI line on targeted
objects. 0 = server enables TLI (local pref valid), 1 = server
disables TLI for all.

30: Flag as to whether weapon linking is enabled or not.

31: (DM) World gravity. This is encoded as an integer 2x the floating
point value, so that ivar30 == 25 -> gravity==12.5. Default = 25

32: (All) Flag as to whether friendly fire is enabled (==1) or not (== 0)

33: (All) Flag as to whether in-game voice chat is enabled (==0) or
not (==1).  Default value is whatever the server's voice chat setting is.

34: (All) Alt-tab tolerate, in seconds

35: (All) Score limit (0 for unlimited)

36 - 50: (ST:FFA) FFA Alliance settings.


63: 0= server not launched; 1=server launched. 

64..127 are usable by DLLs. I do recommend that DLLs use them starting from
127 and working down


70: MPI: Difficulty setting. Used to determine which AI difficulty AIP is used, and certain 
AI behaviors. 0 = Easy, 1 = Normal, 2 = Hard, 4 = Extreme

71: MPI: Random Weapon Crate spawns around the player base. 0 = off, 1 = on.

72: MPI: Mega Beam strikes. 0 = off, 1 = on.

73: MPI: Capture object on/off. 0 = off, 1 = on.

74: MPI: Monster Delay. If this is > 0, Monster ODFs spawn on the AI team. Monster ODF can be 
specified via an svar/instant string var.

75: MPI: Easy Pools on/off. 0 = off, 1 = on.

76: MPI: Rampage unit limit per round. 0 = off.



81: MP Scrap Multiplier. (not used in FE)

89: AI use Day Wreckers in MPI. (not used in FE)

90: Enalbes SiteCam in remote satellite. (not used in FE)

91: If units show Skill Levels in thier names.

115: DLL Logging flag.

120: Map Object save/load. To Save objects, load the game with /ivar 120 1, To Save objects and 
delete the objects after saving, use /ivar 120 3, To Load objects, load the game with /ivar 120 2

121: Prop Height Fix. Similar to /snapscrap but works on objects, moved any sub-terrainian objects 
to ground level.

svars:
0: map name (e.g. foo.bzn)

1: Teamgroup #1 name, usually "Team Red"

2: Teamgroup #2 name, usually "Team Blue"

// Custom AIP name base. The MPInstant.dll will look for several files
// based on this base, with 3 characters tacked on. Those 3 are as
// follows: (1) CPU race (f=Scion, i=isdf), (2) Human race, (3) AIP
// Type (0=Start, 1-3 = begin game types, 'a' == anti-assault, 's' ==
// siege, 'l' = lategame).
//
// If an AIP file is not found, results may be unpredictable.
//
// For example, if svar3 == "foo", at the start of the game, the AIP
// used will be one of these 4 files:
// fooii0.aip  -- CPU ISDF, Human ISDF
// fooif0.aip  -- CPU ISDF, Human Scion
// foofi0.aip  -- CPU Scion, Human ISDF
// fooff0.aip  -- CPU Scion, Human Scion
3: MPI Only: base name for AIP files. If not present, defaults used.
[This var will be reset to empty if not specified in .inf]

4: If specified, this is treated as an alternate filename for the
MPVehicles.txt list; if absent, the game reverts back to the stock
one. This alternate can be in a .pak file, or anywhere in the file
search path. 

5: If specified, this is treated as an alternate recycler base name.
The first character of this is replaced by the race ('i' or 'f'), so
that if svar5=="xGSHrecy", the objects spawned will be either
"iGSHrecy[.odf]" or "fGSHrecy[.odf]" (.odf is implied). If this isn't
present, 'Xvrecy_m' is used, just like before.

6: If specified, this is a file formatted the same as MPVehicles.txt,
but used in the shell config to be a starting force setup for strat.
Default (if not specified) is 'stratstarting.txt' . Strategy02.dll
only lets you pick between 0 and 2 starting turrets; MPInstant.dll
(and the config files) let you use the full set of items.

7: Shell configuration file, for the "Extra Options" page to bring up.
It is extended in code, so that "ctf" tries to bring up
"bzshell_multi_ctf.cfg" for the server, and
"bzshell_multi_client_ctf.cfg" . In each of those pages, there must be
a "ExtraOptions" control, which is used to control all of its
sub-options. When ExtraOptions is deactivated, *all* things must go
away.

   Also, note that if there is a "ExtraOptions.VehicleList" block found,
it is filled in with the contents of the file mentioned in svar6. Note
that if svar6 is empty, the VehicleList section will be blanked out.

8: ODF file of more files to check in the asset list. This is intended
for MODs to be able to protect their assets from cheating. New ODFs
included by a MOD will be checked if either (1) they are referenced
from the .bzn, or (2) they're listed in this file. Assuming svar8
contains say "GSHCheck.odf", then the file 'GSHCheck.odf' (located
somewhere under addon) should contain lines of the following form:

[Check]
Check1 = "ibGSHarmo" // .odf is implied and should NOT be added
Check2 = "ibGSHfact"
Check3 = "ibGSHrecy_m"

   Check numbers must be steadily increasing; if a Check# isn't
present, then processing that file stops. It is recommended that you
list ODFs from lowest on the hierarchy to greatest for smooth loadbar
progression, like I did above. If the recy is first, it'll recursively
load everything (and take a while to do so), and sub-items will go by
in the blink of an eye.

9: Alternate file to be used instead of recylist.txt. If not specified,
recylist.txt is used instead.

10: MPI Only: Alternate file to be used instead of aiplist.txt. If not
specified, aiplist.txt is used instead. 

10: Strat Only: Alternate file to be used instead of
stctfgoallist.txt . If not specified, stctfgoallist.txt is used instead.

11: MPI Only: Team name for a craft on team "group" 3 (teams
11..15). Teams must be on for this to take effect. This is not an
officially supported team group, but support was added for named items
on it. If this svar is empty, the default "Unknown Team" string is
used instead.

11: StratCTF Only: If specified, this is treated as an alternate stratctf
goal odf name. If this isn't present, 'stctf_goal' is used. ".odf" is
implied in the name, and must NOT be on the end

12: DM Only: Config for DM animals. Only valid if DM & ivar27 > 0

12: (MPI only): base config for CPU recyclers present on map.
Defaults to "ivrecycpu" if not specified. ".odf" is implied in the
name, and must NOT be on the end. The specified string is used to
calculate what CPU recyclers (and therefore races) are available by
scanning all 26 possible races of that form. if svar12 = "ivrecyCPU1",
ivrecyCPU1 is the ai's recycler. If ivrecyCPU1.odf does not exist, but
fvrecyCPU1.odf and evrechCPU1.odf exist, the only available options
for the ai team are Scion and Hadean. ISDF can't be chosen for the AI
team due to that odf not existing.

13: DM Only: Alternate file to be used instead of animallist.txt. If
not specified, animallist.txt is used instead.


19: Monster ODF to spawn.

20: Capture object ODF to spawn.

21: Easy Pool ODF to spawn.


28: Map Object Replacer: ODF name to replace an object with.
29: Map Object Replacer: ODF name to find, replaces with the value in svar28.

31: Map Loader ODF to save, if specified. If blank, saves the entire map. This can be a partial 
match with just the starting part of ODF, for instance "iv" will save all ISDF vehicles 
found.

civars:
0: Which team this player is on (0==team1, 1==team2)

1: Vehicle selection (as bitfield paralleling ivar4; only 1 bit allowed on)

2: Team commander prefs (but overridden by server as needed. 
   0 = commander, 1 = thug)

3: Autolevel (0 = off, 1 = on)

csvars:
0: Player name
1: Nav name for next-created one.
