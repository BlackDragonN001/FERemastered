   The Scions have sent a
unit to help free Core from
the Cerberi. They pinpointed
the center of Cerberi biometal
harvesting here on Core, but
suffered heavy casualties 
during a Cerberi attack.
   You must assume temporary
command of the Scion unit and,
if the Matriarch can be fixed,
oversee destruction of the
biometal harvesting operation.
