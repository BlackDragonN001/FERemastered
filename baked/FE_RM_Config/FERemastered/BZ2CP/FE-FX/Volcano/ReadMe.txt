VULCANO

Config names : vfire
               vsomke
               verupt
               vlava
               
- set all to team 2
- Place all in the same place. (the vlava on a slightly tilted surface nearby)

Notes: When making the terrain, make sure of 2 things: 1. That the place they're placed on is completely
flat (may be tiny, but if it's not level the eruption will 'lean' to one side) and 2. that the slope
for the lava is right. You'll have to test it to make sure the lava flows, and doesn't 'jump' or
get 'stuck'. Also, when placing the vlava mine, place that one on a slightly tilted surface, otherwise
it won't start to flow. A good idea is to make a 'hole' in the terrain where the lava flows into at the
bottom, to hide it's sudden end.
