Portals
-------
PortalA0 - PortalA9: units emerging from these portals goto path point "hold1"
PortalB0 - PortalB9: units emerging from these portals goto path point "hold2"
PortalC0 - PortalC9: units emerging from these portals goto path point "hold3"
PortalD0 - PortalD9: units emerging from these portals goto path point "hold4"
PortalE0 - PortalE9: reserved for Cerberi units, built at path point "groupE"
PortalF0 - PortalF9: reserved for units patroling paths "portalPatrol#"

Portals must be object "hbport" and they must be assigned to team "0".  Be sure to
orient portals within a group alike.  For portal group "F" be sure to set up the 
corresponding patrol paths so the assigned units always enter on the same side.  
For all portals, make sure the emerging unit can move directly away from the portal 
immediately.  If a unit assigned to a given portal group moves too near any portal
in that group, it will be "captured" by the portal and transported to the next
portal in the group.

Units to be assigned to the portal groups must be assigned to team "6" and placed
very near the portal which they will enter when created.  The DLL will remove these
"seed" units at game session start.  Unit names must follow the pattern "PortalUser$"
where "$" is a capital alphabetic letter, "A" through "Z".  The standard portal-using
units with their standard names and default portal (or hold point) assignments are:

evpumislu - PortalUserA - PortalA0 - hold1
ivpurckt - PortalUserB - PortalA0 - hold1
fvpuarch - PortalUserC - PortalA0 - hold1
evpuatank - PortalUserD - PortalB0 - hold2
ivpurbomb - PortalUserE - PortalB0 - hold2
fvpurbomb - PortalUserF - PortalB0 - hold2
evpuatanku - PortalUserG - PortalC0 - hold3
ivpuatank - PortalUserH - PortalC0 - hold3
fvpuwalk - PortalUserI - PortalC0 - hold3
ivpuewalk - PortalUserJ - PortalD0 - hold4
ivpuwalk - PortalUserK - PortalD0 - hold4
fvpuatank - PortalUserL - PortalD0 - hold4
evputurr - PortalUserM - PortalD0 - hold4
ivputurr - PortalUserN - PortalD0 - hold4
fvputurr - PortalUserO - PortalD0 - hold4
cvpuscout - PortalUserP - PortalE0
cvputank - PortalUserQ - PortalE0
cvpuatank - PortalUserR - PortalE0
cvpurbomb - PortalUserS - PortalE0
cvpuwalk - PortalUserT - PortalE0
evpuscout - PortalUserU - PortalF0
ivpuscout - PortalUserV - PortalF0
fvpusent - PortalUserW - PortalF0
evputank - PortalUserX - PortalF0
ivputank - PortalUserY - PortalF0
fvputank - PortalUserZ - PortalF0

Allied Race Units:
avpuesct2 - PortalUser1 - PortalE0
avpuemisl2 - PortalUser2 - PortalE0
avpueatnk2 - PortalUser3 - PortalE0
avpuimbk2 - PortalUser4 - PortalE0
avpuirbmb2 - PortalUser5 - PortalE0
avpuirckt2 - PortalUser6 - PortalE0
avpufsct2 - PortalUser7 - PortalE0
avpufrbmb2 - PortalUser8 - PortalE0
avpufwalk2 - PortalUser9 - PortalE0

Units assigned to portals should be "pu" variants only.  The complete type list
supported is: "vputank", "vpuatank", "vpuwalk", "vpuewalk", "vpuscout", "vpusent", "vpumisl", "vpuarch", "vpurckt", "vpuscav", "vpuserv", "vpumbike", "vpumort", "vputanku", "vpuatanku", "vpumislu", "vpurbomb", "vputurr".

The AIP files may contain "BuildMinimums" plans for units assigned to PortalA0, 
PortalB0, PortalC0 and PortalD0.  These portals are intended to be paired with 
one other portal of their group which lies near one of the hold points, hold1, hold2, 
hold3, or hold4.  As units emerge from the paired portal, they will be directed by
the DLL to the associated hold point.  From there the DLL sends the group to attack
the human team's base.  These units will go to the hold point even if the assigned
portal group does not exist or has been destroyed.

At least three units are expected to be sent to PortalA0 and PortalB0 to be sent
to attack the human base.  Otherwise, the units will stay at the hold point until at
least three units are sent to the hold point through the portal.  At least two units
are required for the attack through PortalC0 and PortalD0.

Cerberi and other allied race units, ODF names beginning with "a", are built by the 
DLL at path point "groupE" and immediately go to PortalE0.  When they emerge from 
one of the other PortalE# portals, they are sent to attack human team base buildings 
and units by the DLL.  PortalE0 and the "groupE" path point should be placed "off map" 
where the players can not easily approach them.

The AIP files may contain "BuildMinimums" plans for units assigned to PortalF0.  
When they are built, these units immediately go to the assigned portal.  When they 
emerge from another portal in the group, they are sent by the DLL to the associated 
"portalPatrol#" path.  This path may be a loop which returns to the same portal, 
or it may lead to another portal in the group.  These patroling units will patrol 
each path and teleport to the next in a continuous cycle.


Notes
-----
a) Avoid locating the computer team base on the south side of the map.  Computer team buildings are always oriented facing south.  By placing the base in the north, or to the east or west, units emerging from the recycler and factory will have less difficulty moving out of the base.  Otherwise, the recycler and factory can be an obstacle to the free movement of these vehicles.

b) The large base buildings occupy four grid squares.  Mid-size buildings occupy two squares.  When placing path points for these buildings, do not center the path point on the building's desired location, as would be done for the smaller one-square buildings.  Place the pathpoint in the center of the lower or lower-left square to ensure the larger building is properly placed.

c) The "required" path points must be placed on the map.  The computer team cannot be placed and function without them.

d) The "semi-required" path points are needed to locate key buildings.  Failure to place these path points may not cause the computer team to malfunction, but it may result in haphazard base development.  Furthermore, failure to carefully plan the placement of power generators and other buildings can result in a placement conflict during the course of a game session.  The computer team will "freeze" and not be able to proceed if it cannot build a required structure because of placement conflict.

e) The "optional" path points may be omitted to avoid placing the associated start-up units.  Be aware that start-up units requiring power will need an appropriate number of power generators somewhere on the map at start up.  These power generators may be near the powered units, as they would normally appear, or they may actually be located beyond the map's "edge_path" to prevent their destruction by players.

f) Hadean and EDF base buildings must be placed contiguously.  Careful planning and placement of the path points is required to avoid placement conflict and construction failure because of "gaps" between buildings.  On the other hand, the Scion operate more efficiently if their buildings are given some placement separation.  The base buildings are constructed in this order by location: 

    Hadean - pgen1, spike1, epgen1, fact, cbun, pgen2, spike2, armo, sbay, 
	epgen2, pgen3, spike3, def1, def2, def3, pgen4, gt4, gt4a, pgen5, gt5, 
	pgen6, gt6, train, tcen, pgen7, gt7
    EDF - ipgen1, pgen1, spike1, ipgen2, fact, cbun, ipgen3, pgen2, spike2, armo,
	ipgen4, pgen3, spike3, ipgen5, sbay, ipgen6, def1, def2, def3, ipgen7, 
	train/tcen, ipgen8, bbay, pgen4, gt4, gt4a, pgen5, gt5, tcen/train, 
	ipgen9, pgen6, gt6, pgen7, gt7 (ipgens are power, pgens are bunkers)
    Scion - kiln, antm, dowe, spike1, spike2, stro, spike3, def1, def2,	def3, 
	gt4, gt4a, gt5, gt6, gt7

g) The path points "spike1" and "def1" must be placed contiguous to "pgen1".
h) The path points "spike2" and "def2" must be placed contiguous to "pgen2".
i) The path points "spike3" and "def3" must be placed contiguous to "pgen3".
j) The path points "gt4" and "gt4a" must be placed contiguous to "pgen4".
k) The path point "gt5" must be placed contiguous to "pgen5".
l) The path point "gt6" must be placed contiguous to "pgen6".
m) The path point "gt7" must be placed contiguous to "pgen7".

n) Place the "stage" points carefully to give attacking units an unobstructed path to the player team base area.  Attacking units that get blocked by the terrain may cause the computer team to "freeze" and prevent progress beyond that point in their strategy.

o) avoid placing start-up objects, especially set-pieces, on path points where objects will be built during the game session, even if they are of the same type.  This will help avoid construction conflicts.

p) RECOMMENDATION: to test computer team base building without having to fight off attacking hordes, follow these steps:

   1) make a backup copy of the *inst0*.aip file
   2) replace the content of the *inst0*.aip file with *inst1*.aip
   3) strip out all attacker plans from the new *inst0*.aip file
   4) strip out CollectField plans, if there is no loose scrap on the map
   5) start an MPI session using the modified map
   6) DO NOT DEPLOY YOUR RECYCLER
   7) observe the computer team constructor(s) until base building is complete

   As long as you do not deploy your recycler, the DLL will not switch to another plan file, so you will not have to face attackers and can observe the computer team's base construction in relative peace.  Be careful not to approach the computer team's recycler too closely; otherwise, the DLL will switch to the siege AIP file and begin building attack groups.  The safe distance for stock DLL maps is 300m.  For the modified FE DLL, the distance is 150m.  By this means, base construction testing is simplified, allowing rapid turnaround between testing, map modification, aip file modification and retesting.  Once this testing is completed, restore the *inst0*.aip file from the backup you made.

q) RECOMMENDATION: always place some loose scrap on the map.  This will get the computer team scavs moving right away so they do not block the recycler and keep the constructor from moving freely.  It doesn't have to be much.  Place four to six pieces of scrap at five to nine locations around the map.  No more than two or three of these scrap fields should be located near the human team base area.
