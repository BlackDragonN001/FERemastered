PERSONAL LOG
Major Joseph Corber, EDF
Date: 1.25.2010

I have failed my men, my country, and my world.

The VENGEANCE has been destroyed, and with it all our hopes of discovering the Hadean fleet's battle plans. I led the remaining men back to Tranquility and ordered the WorldPortal destroyed behind us, hoping to buy us a little time.

But it's not going to matter.  General Hardin has risked radioing from the StormPetrel to warn us that a full wing of the Hadean fleet is now headed for Tranquility. They will probably start their landing and assault in about six hours or so. Hardin estimates that the Imperial Hadeans' wing includes approximately twelve Recyclers and well over a thousand vehicles. Our remaining squadron--seven tanks and a service vehicle--will will be quickly overwhelmed. 

The odds are worse than Davie Crockett's men faced at the Alamo, but we have resolved to fight to the death, to buy the StormPetrel time to escape the Labyrinth system. Hardin has already sent a HyperWave message to the Scions on ruined Core; our old allies are planning to open their wormhole near Spartacus just as the StormPetrel reaches it. If they time it right, they may have a chance.

But there is no chance for us. And without the VENGEANCE--and intelligence about the Hadeans' battle plans--there's little chance for Earth. Our sacrifice is probably in vain, but I haven't told the men that. 

It's the least I can do.
