   I thought that *I* was cutting it close--but General Hardin reached the INTREPID even later than the Condor did. He had stuffed a transport full of plasma torpedoes and docked at the Wormhole main power plant. The general triggered a timing mechanism to detonate two minutes after we entered the wormhole, then jetted back to the INTREPID in a space-suit and knocked on our door. We dragged him inside and slammed the airlock door again just five seconds before the Wormhole activated.
   The Wormhole bends space-time, so I have no idea how long we've been traveling. The tiniest fold in space-time could have lengthened our travel by a period of weeks or months. Still, the INTREPID is shaking from gravity-turbulence, so I know we're nearing the exit. All of us are looking forward to the end of our journey with a mixture of anticipation and dread. Are we heading for home...or just another Hadean colony?
