Lieutenant Corbin,
Excellent work on your first independent command today. I had supported your assignment despite the objections of another officer. I'm pleased to be proven right, though I had little doubt that you and your men would meet or exceed our expectations. Please pass along the General's commendations to your entire command.

Aside from protecting a valuable Recycler, your squadron has gathered priceless information on the Hadean transport system. Our analysts have determined that the Portal structures are a combination of transporter, power source, and a virtually impenetrable shield which channels all shots fired at it through the Portal itself. The Portals use staggering amounts of energy to manipulate time and space at the subnuclear level, in order to create an artificial wormhole between any two Portals.

From an operational perspective, this means that the Hadeans can use their Portal system to transit great distances with astonishing speed; Intel believes that the same technology may be applied to interstellar and possibly even intergalactic space.

This discovery bears disturbing implications for the security of Earth. It's quite possible that the outcome of our operations here on Spartacus will determine the fate of the entire human race.

An all-hands meeting will be held at 1800 hours tonight in the main briefing hall in order to discuss this information and General Hardin's operational plan. I look forward to seeing you there and, once again, congratulations.

Sincerely,
Col. Robert Stewart, (RetinalSigned)
Adjutant to General Hardin
