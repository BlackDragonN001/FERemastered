PERSONAL LOG
Colonel Joseph Corber, EDF
Date: 3.15.2007

I lost the Procreator, and the war. Most of our Hadean force has been taken prisoner, and Earth is going to be next. The Scions are gone, but at least they'll never be Cerberized.

As we retreated to our dropships, the Scions made a valiant stab at destroying the Transporter with their antimatter gun. I saw the whole thing from our dropship's window: the first red bolt flaring down like lightning from an avenging god, answered by six pairs of strobes flashing all around us. Long orange snakes sniffed the darkness and slithered up toward the stars, finally vanishing as the phase-shift torpedoes activated their masking technology. Night flashed into day with a star-birth explosion as the twelve torpedoes detonated beside the Ark II.

A cloak of blackness fell once more, but half a minute later the massive vessel herself appeared, arcing across the sky in a deadly rainbow, slashing a wide swath in the darkness and blasting shock waves through the planet's thin atmosphere. Our own dropship staggered with the Ark's close passage, but she recovered and strained for the stars once again. 

Until the walls of hell crashed down on our heads. The Ark erupted in a blazing fireball more brilliant than a thousand suns. A sledgehammer blow smashed into our dropship, sending her into a death spiral toward the ground below. None of us had time to even think about the cyanide capsules in our "survival" kits. None of us figured we'd need them. We were wrong.

I woke to find myself in a holding pen near the Cerberizer Vats. Most of our squadron has already been marched away, four at a time, never to return.

Only four of us are left.
