The WorldPortal has taken us to a network of caves deep beneath the surface of the planet Facility. The rebels tell of a potential weakness in the planet's early-warning system: a pair of lightly-guarded control nodes hidden somewhere in these caves. By accessing these modules, Captain Eisenstein can fool the planetary defense grid into accepting our force as part of the regular Hadean garrison. The disguise won't fool individual Hadean pilots, but it may buy us enough time to finish our mission.

But our time is limited for other reasons, too. These caves are swarming with regular patrols that must soon detect and report our presence.  High above Facility, the Hadean fleet is coming together near an orbital Wormhole entrance; we have to discover their target before the fleet departs. Worst of all, it's only a matter of time before the Hadean commanders realize they have lost Tranquility. Our rebel friends are doing their best to hide the truth by forging status reports and communiques, but the ruse can't last much longer.  Once the Loyalists realize we have seized the WorldPortal leading from Tranquility to Facility, they'll know exactly where to find us.

Our force is too small to survive a firefight. We have to finish our mission quickly and steal away, or we'll never again see the light of day.
