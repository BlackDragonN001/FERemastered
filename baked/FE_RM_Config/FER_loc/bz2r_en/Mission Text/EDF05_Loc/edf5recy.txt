The Recycler has been destroyed. Without the Recycler, we were unable to complete our mission or, indeed, protect the StormPetrel from ground forces and surface-to-space missiles (SSMs). A lucky shot by an SSM installation near your position brought the StormPetrel down in a huge meteoric fireball that turned the night sky into day.

The Hadeans completed their StarPortal to our solar system just a few weeks later.  Earth was quickly subjugated and converted to a resort colony for vacationing Hadean sportsmen.  Less than six months after your catastrophic mistake, the last remnants of humanity were hunted to extinction. 

The Scion homeworlds soon followed suit, although most of the Scions were kept alive. The healthiest specimens have been brought to Earth, where they now roam nature preserves and provide an excellent challenge to discriminating Hadean hunters.
