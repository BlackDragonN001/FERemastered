Here are some notes concerning the soundmines:

Basically, they are just modified Bolt Mines. Soundcubes are of little use, because they are VERY quiet, and you can't modify any parameters. Apart from the obvious tweaks (undetectable, no 'bolt' effects, high armour/ammo/lifetime) one important thing I did was to change the Bolt weapon to a projectile one with a very short lifetime. Reason being, even though the bolt caused no damage or was seen, you would still hear the 'unit under attack' blip when one of your units was in range.
Here's some tips:
- Every mine uses 3 odfs, but since the third one is the same for every mine, I made a single def.odf for all of them. Just make sure it's in Addon at all times, whichever mines you use. 
- If you want to tweak the odfs: Only the stuff marked with arrows is of any importance. The 'search radius' is actually a tricky thing, because it depends on how long the sound is, and especially on how loud it is heard in the game (which differs greatly from it's volume in Winamp, for ex.) - I am quite happy with the settings the way they are (did a whole day of experimenting to get them right!). The 'shot delay' is obviously the timespan before the sound is heard again. Try out diffent settings if you like, but you'll notice the quality of the overall 'jungle' effect varies with the number of mines. I find it better to place more mines with longer settings than a few ones with short delays. This way you hear sounds coming from 'everywhere' and get a better effect.
-  I would suggest you listen to all the sounds in winamp first, to get an idea of what they sound like (careful - the volumes will be different in the actual game!). 
- There is only one looped, 'constant' sound: water. These looped sounds are the only ones which may have 'dropouts' sometimes - only if there are too many other mines close by. If you put it in one of the water pools in the jungle, don't place any other mines right next to it. For rivers and lakes spread them out evenly (I compensated for the dropout effect by having a shorter shot delay than the actual length of the sound - I didn't have a single dropout on your map (and I used a lot of them!!))
- When placing mines, you obviously have to set them to 'team 2'. Don't know it the 'skill' has any effect, but set it to max anyway. I was thinking of making them 'invisible' by stripping the XSI, but decided against it because it makes them easier to remove in the editor (that means you need to place them slight beneath the terrain)
- The 'amb_wind.wav' is the sound that a unit makes when it jumps and then 'falls' making that hissing sound. Well, I've always hated it for some reason, but since in the forest you're constantly flying over those roots, it became intolerable!  I've radically changed the volume, and find it much more fun to fly this way!
