Our food and water supplies are just about gone. We desperately need the StormPetrel's life support equipment, but the Megaguns would blast it to pieces once it exited the wormhole.

Orbital sensors have pinpointed the Spartacus Megagun. Build a base and then capture or destroy the Megagun so the StormPetrel can safely deliver our equipment.
