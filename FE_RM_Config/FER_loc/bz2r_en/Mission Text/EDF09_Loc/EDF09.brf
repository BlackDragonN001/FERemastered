Miasma has jolted to life with the sudden and vicious fury of a planetary Frankenstein. And just like that legendary creature, this deadly world has gone on a rampage, bent on destroying its tormentors. 

Unfortunately, Miasma's "consciousness" makes no distinction between us and the Cerberi who have savaged its environment for so long; volcanos and earthquakes care little for the squabbling of mortals. At least the Cerberi are too preoccupied to face us in battle...our clashes are random and sporadic, mere child's play compared with Miasma's frenzied quakes, explosive eruptions, and hailstorms of fiery biometal. 

We have to get out of here, NOW.  There's no time for planning, or repairs, or reconnaissance. We must get the VENGEANCE to the StarPortal before Miasma's deranged fury claims us forever.
