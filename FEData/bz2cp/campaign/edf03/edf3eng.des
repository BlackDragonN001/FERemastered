Your duty was clearly stated: protect the engineers at all costs. If they had made it to the Megapower, they could have reverse-engineered the Hadean defenses and brought them under our control. You have failed in your mission and left us here stranded. Without the StormPetrel's life support systems, we will die a miserable death of hunger and thirst knowing that our homeworld will soon fall to the Hadean assault.
