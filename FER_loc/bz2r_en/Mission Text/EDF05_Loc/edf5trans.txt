You failed to protect the troop transport as you were ordered. The transport was carrying an entire squad of pilots vital to the ultimate survival of the task force. All twenty of them died when the transport exploded.

It's too bad that one of them wasn't piloting your tank; even the greenest recruit could have done a better job against a mere handful of lightly-armed Hadean tanks. 

Consider yourself relieved of duty, effective immediately.
