PERSONAL LOG
Major Joseph Corber, EDF
Date: 1.25.2010

I blew it.  I let one of the Hadean scouts escape with word of our activities. The Imperials figured out our plans and followed the trail of jammers back to our Recycler and the elevator from the caves. We fled through the WorldPortal to Tranquility and destroyed it behind us, but Hadeans are hot on our trail.

General Hardin and the StormPetrel have left their hiding place in the asteroid field to attempt a rescue. They had little choice: the VENGEANCE is Earth's last functioning Recycler until the new models are completed. As such, she is far more valuable than all the men and machinery in the rest of the task force, including the StormPetrel herself.

It's a futile gesture all the same. The 'Petrel's officers have spotted an entire wing of space-fighters vectoring away from the Hadean fleet on an intercept course. With their greater speed and numbers, they will surely overwhelm the StormPetrel and her puny laser-cannon defenses long before she reaches us.

Another Hadean detachment is on its way directly to Tranquility; they should start landing in just a few hours. The men are hoping to hold out until the 'Petrel arrives, but she never will. I haven't told them, and I've sworn the comm officer to silence. 

The men will fight harder if they can hold onto a flicker of hope--however misguided.
