Mountain Pass is experimental map using landscape deformations to simulate the experience of flying through trees. While not as graphics intensive as real tree props, there are many overlapping polygons and multi layered textures. If you experience graphics slowdowns try:


* lowering terrain settings to medium or low (biggest help)
* reducing visibilty range
* particles lowered will help in battle situations

Goes into Root/FEaddon/Missions/Multiplayer/CP Mntn Pass.
