RE:  SUMMARY PROMOTION
Verification code:  80239-zHW2.q
CC:  Joseph Corber, EDF-R


This communication represents official notice of the pending award of a Space Cross for Major Joseph Corber, EDF-R, for outstanding leadership and conspicuous gallantry during the Facility campaign. Coupled with this award is an emergency order for Major Corber to be advanced to the level of Lieutenant Colonel. The justifications for the Space Cross and field promotion are as follows:

1) OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP IN THE FACILITY CAMPAIGN: Major Corber's leadership has been instrumental in this campaign's success. He guided the entire process from the field and maintained the integrity of our missions and forces, from the seizure of the WorldPortal on Tranquility through the stealth and surgical strikes designed to confuse Facility's defenses, to the final destruction of the Cerberi Recycler and seizure of the tunnel leading to the Wormhole Control Center. 

2) CONSPICUOUS GALLANTRY UNDER FIRE: Despite the tragic loss of the VENGEANCE and Colonel Stewart, Corber rallied his remaining forces and led a nearly singlehanded attack against the Imperials' computerized defenses. He subsequently commanded a large allied force of Hadean rebels against an overwhelming Cerberi presence, smashing a heavy regiment and helping to gain complete control of that sector of Facility. 

This promotion is to take effect immediately. The usual and customary waiting period will be waived, in accordance with EDF Executive Order 734-h, Subparagraph iv:
   "...due to the urgent necessity of a response and the likelihood of substantial communication delays, as Secretary-General I hereby grant to Major-General Miles Hardin, Theater Commander, and his successors and assigns the powers of summary judgment, execution, and promotion, provided sufficient documentation is provided and the exigencies of the situation--from General Hardin's perspective--necessitate such actions."

This elevation in rank is effective immediately and is fully inclusive, that is, accompanied by the commensurate pay, benefits, and other rights and privileges attendant to a Lieutenant Colonel serving in hostile territory.

Solemnly attested to by my hand and retinal signature, I am,

Your faithful servant,


Major-General Miles Hardin (EDF-P12), Theater Commander, Labyrinth System
