You managed to rescue all but one of the Team Alpha survivors. We will all miss Sgt. LeBlanc, but your rescue of the other nine survivors averted a major catastrophe. This is especially true because General Hardin was leading Team Alpha despite the objections of his aides. The General sustained a minor concussion during the crash, but he wishes to thank you personally when he is released from Sick Bay.

Well done, Lieutenant Corber.
