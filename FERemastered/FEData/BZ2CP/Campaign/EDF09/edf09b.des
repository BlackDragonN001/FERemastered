As you are surely aware, the EDF Technical Manual (document # 72480-RD/U) firmly limits the deployment and undeployment of Recyclers to no more than two cycles per day. Sergeant Wong tried to remind you of this fact, but you ignored his warnings. In compliance with your direct order, he attempted to undeploy the VENGEANCE again.

As expected, critical traction/drive linkages were stripped due to the phenomenon of "biometal memory" and incomplete cooling of the gear assemblies. Sergeant Wong had estimated that repairs would take at least a full week, under ideal circumstances. Unfortunately, the recent massive quakes have caused even more damage, cracking the biometal processing core and rendering the VENGEANCE a total loss.

The Cerberi and Hadeans are massing for a final assault, but without a Recycler, we are virtually defenseless.
