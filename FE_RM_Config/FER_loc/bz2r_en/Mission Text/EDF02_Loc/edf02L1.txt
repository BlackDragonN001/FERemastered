The Recycler was destroyed and dozens of good men were killed, all because of your inept mismanagement of the squadron. Without the Recycler and your base on our eastern flank, the Hadeans have taken the high ground near our main base and are shelling us at will. Our defenses have been pummeled by twelve hours of constant bombardment in preparation for a final push by the enemy. 

Even as you read this, the Hadeans are gathering for a massive counterassault against our main base, intended to drive us off Spartacus for good. If they succeed, we will have lost our only chance to bar the Hadeans from our solar system.
