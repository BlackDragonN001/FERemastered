The StormPetrel continued on to the ruined planet of Core without further incident. The Ark's survivors welcomed you with open arms, assuming that your aged starcarrier was just the advance force of an entire fleet. But the Scions' attitude quickly chilled once they learned that no reinforcements are planned. They consider the paltry response a slap in the face, betraying a total disregard for their frantic warning.

The Ark's colonists had originally planned to join forces with Earth in order to stem the Hadean tide at the Labyrinth System. Instead, the outraged Scions now plan to leave for their homeworlds in order to raise a force of their own. General Hardin has struck a deal: our force will help complete repairs on the Ark II, and the colonists will use their WormDrive to get us through the Labyrinth wormhole.

The Scions warn of a powerful interplanetary defense grid, so Hardin has sent five dropships for preliminary recon while keeping the StormPetrel in reserve. Your group has penetrated the wormhole and emerged near Spartacus, fourth planet in the Labyrinth System. Alpha and Bravo's dropships will now conduct stealth landings to scout the planet's defenses.
