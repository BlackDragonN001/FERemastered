Well, here are all my currently developed weapons. Below is a description of what each does... 

Extract these into your Addon directory. The Filename in the description is what you type (w/o the .odf extension) into the editor to use it.


------------------------

Ammo Jetpack

Filename: apamjet.odf

Desc: This is a jetpack that uses all of your ammo as a pilot, allowing it to recharge. The special effects are slightly modified, and the pack itself is much less effective, to compensate for its reusability.

------------------------

Irradiator/Overloader

Filename: aparmrad.odf

Desc: This colorful gun overloads Scion shielding, doing increased damage for more powerful shields. In assault mode, it irradiates armor, basically doing the same thing for armored vehicles (heavy vehicles take more damage).

------------------------

Dragon Bolt

Filename: apdragb.odf

Desc: This is a powerful blast cannon that ignites the air around it, creating a wash of flame. It has a low rate of fire, but the impact washes across the terrain, damaging vehicles even if it didn't hit them.

------------------------

Electron Cloud

Filename: apelect.odf

Desc: You've seen this in the sample Forest map - the Xares (I think) fired these Plasma-like bolts of blue.  The assault mode version is a neat red color....

------------------------

Flare Gun

Filename: apflaregun.odf

Desc: This pack weapon uses your regular ammo supply to fire off a flare rocket that detonates on impact or after 80 meters. It gives off an INTENSE light, illuminating even the darkest maps...

------------------------

Focus Beam

Filename: apflaregun.odf  (fbspir--.odf for demo usage)

Desc: This is a Flash-like weapon, designed for Hadean gun towers (whether or not it will be used there is in discussion.)  It does damage at a similar rate to a Gun Spire's Arc Cannon, but fires continuously.  It takes a fraction of a second to impact, so fast vehicles may be able to dodge it.

------------------------

Hang Glider

Filename: aphanglider.odf

Desc: This is still in the prototype stage, and needs a new model, but currently, when activated, lets you almost ignore gravity and glide off a cliff face for 60 seconds.

------------------------

Mine Layer

Filename: apminfield.odf

Desc: Firing this off launches 20 mortars that scatter and deploy into a long-lasting minefield.  Excellent for blocking areas off - the AI even tries to avoid the field (unless you make them really mad ;) )

------------------------

Neutron Bomb

Filename: apneutron.odf

Desc: This mortar, when fired into a cluster of enemy tanks, does little damage but can kill off a great number of their pilots. Beware - it's also dangerous to friendlies.

------------------------

Surface-to-Air Missile

Filename: apsam.odf

Desc: I think the name's pretty self-explanatory... but just to clarify, this is a pilot-mounted rocket launcher that fires homing missiles - effective against light units (like many aircraft), but poor against heavier ones.

------------------------

ShockRocket

Filename: apshockrock.odf

Desc: This cannon, when in combat mode, is similar to an SP-Stabber, but shakes the target slightly, making it hard to fight back.  In assault mode, this rocket gives off shockwave pulses, and sends units FLIPPING upon impact - useful for disrupting enemy tank squads.

------------------------

Smoke Grenade

Filename: apsmoke.odf

Desc: Yet another pilot weapon, this grenade clouds an area for a long time with thick gray smoke. Note that I may need to tone down the effects, as they are rather hard on framerate.

------------------------

Snare Field

Filename: apsnare.odf

Desc: I've saved the best for last :) .... This is a Hadean mine. When dropped, it forms a small field of snare mines - when an enemy tank drives near, they activate, grabbing the tank with orange arc beams and slowly draining the craft's armor.  It's rather hard to escape from, thus the name.

------------------------


Well, there you go. Give 'em a try!
