Your engineers have cut power to the Megagun. Capture the Megagun so that we can destroy the other Megaguns in Labyrinth System. Only then will it be safe for the StormPetrel to enter the system.

Major Wyndt-Essex now commands the task force, along with our last reserve Recycler. The EDF-R VENGEANCE has equipment for the latest weapon and ship designs.
