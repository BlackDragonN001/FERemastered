Excellent landing under the circumstances Captain. Our orbital scanners show that 
the blast came from over 100 km away, so it's just as well that you brought her 
down in that canyon. It looks like there's some sort of powerful long range 
energy weapon, and there may be more of them. Lt Corber, lead the Recycler 
farther north, it's the only way to go to avoid the Hadeans.
