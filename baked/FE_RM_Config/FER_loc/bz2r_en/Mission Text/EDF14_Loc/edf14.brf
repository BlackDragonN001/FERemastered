The surface of Facility is a hive of industrial activity: factories and smokestacks, mills and assembly lines, canals and bridges and roadways. Facility's rivers and streams ooze poison like pus from a gangrenous wound, and no sunlight could ever pierce the pall of sickly green clouds over- head. All traces of native life are long extinct; this blighted world's heart now beats only with the dull mechanical throb of heavy machinery.

We all realize that Earth may be next unless we defeat the Imperial Hadeans and the Cerberi. Fortunately General Hardin has come up with a plan to drive a wedge of suspicion between the two forces. Working with the Cerberi vehicles we captured on Miasma, Eisenstein has configured the VENGEANCE to build rough mockups of Cerberi Krul and Siren tanks. We will use a squadron of the counterfeit Cerberi to attack a nearby Hadean base, then allow the garrison to spread the alarm. General Thanatos has lent us a Hadean Creator to build a network of radio- frequency jammers; the jamming will pause just long enough for the Hadeans to report the "rogue Cerberi" attack. Once this occurs, we must seize the base and destroy a nearby geothermal power station before reinforcements arrive.

It's a tall order--but right now, it's our only hope.
