	Your failure to protect the transport led to its destruction, along with all our supplies and spare parts. Our central air-cooling unit malfunctioned just twelve hours later, and we were unable to replace the failed part. The planet's extreme heat quickly took their toll on the rest of our equipment; over the next two days we lost our water purification systems, food synthesizers, and finally the air filtration units.
	We survived for two more days by living in our vehicles, but dehydration and "biometal madness" eventually claimed the rest of us. Our failure left Earth open to Hadean attack; within just two months, the remnants of humanity have been enslaved, and Earth now serves as a resort world for elite and wealthy Hadeans.
