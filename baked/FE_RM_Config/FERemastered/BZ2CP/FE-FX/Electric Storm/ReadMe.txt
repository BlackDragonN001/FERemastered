ELECTRIC STORM

Config name: estorm1 - estorm3

There are 3 versions with different shot delays in order to make the effect look 'homogenous' when used together

Set 'team' to 2, and place about 20-30 (10 of each) mines in a certain area.

Notes: Sometimes your units will try to fire at the mines, eventhough they are undetectable.
