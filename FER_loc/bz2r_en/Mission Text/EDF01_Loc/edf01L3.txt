You have allowed the Hadean forces to completely saturate the area. Immediate withdrawal represents our only hope for survival.

Unfortunately, we will be leaving General Hardin behind. He was leading Team Alpha despite the objections of your peers. Apparently, the General has been captured by the Hadeans and transferred to one of their notorious "interrogation centers." We can only hope he resists torture long enough to permit our escape.

Major Wyndt-Essex had strongly objected to your leading this mission, citing your "stunning incompetence and lack of decorum." She was obviously correct--General Hardin's rescue couldn't have been in worse hands than yours.
