Hi guys !

Here are the Quake flies plus some fireflies...

Flies (flymine.odf) :
Only way to make them was to use modified smoke textures spinning around. Place 3 mines in a triangle (about the size of a tank) - experiment to see what looks the best, so that one doesn't see the 'spinning' motion too much. As with all smoke fx, they really drop the fps when you're close - try driving through them, you'll see what I mean. No way around that unfortunately. Chip has the right sounds for a soundmine. Also - you'll need the highest effect settings to see them properly. On mid or low they either sit still, or are much too small.

IMPORTANT : These flies, like the waterfalls, are 'one shot' fx. This means you must place them on the map AS THE LAST THING, and save it immediately afterwards. This is because the mine expires a few seconds after the start - although the 'flies' remain, if the map is saved after the mines expire, they (the mines) of course won't be present the next time the map is launched, and thus can't generate the fly effect.

Fireflies (firefly.odf) :
These will have to be adjusted to the map (environment) - right now they're green and probably much too big. They're simply birdies with a light source (only way to get them to fly around randomly).

Try them out, and let me know if anything's to be changed!
