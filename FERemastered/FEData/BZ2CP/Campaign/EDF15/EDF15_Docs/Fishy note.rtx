 <BR>
I wanted to tell you about the edf15 movie. the arrival of the Condor.<BR>
The bik file (without sound) will be around 12 MB. I think this is reasonably possible to download. I could still make a choppy, very packed version for 56K ers.<BR>
the movie takes around 16s and shows Facility and then the arrival of Condor and 3 Corvettes.<BR>
All I need now is a good VO. Who will tell the player that the Condor arrived?<BR>
I'll post the latest movie on the board when I have uploaded it.<BR>
 <BR>
the line for the mission.odf would be:<BR>
successMovie = "Condor.bik"<BR>
<BR>

Thanks for the info, Fishy!&nbsp; I'll make sure I include the line in the mission.odf file.&nbsp; I'm just starting work on the VO's for EDF15 now (finished the BRF and DES files and the voicemail stuff).&nbsp; As for who will tell Corber (the player) that the Condor has arrived, I'm pretty sure it'll be Hardin himself, though I'm not certain of that.&nbsp; Schultz will of course be gone, and I'll probably bump Stewart off (for the second and final time) when the VENGEANCE gets popped. That leaves Eisenstein, Sgt. Wong, and Hardin.&nbsp; Eisenstein will be playing a big role, in that he'll be responsible for the virus.&nbsp; Hardin isn't on-planet, but presumably he's the one who's sending the Condor to help us on Facility, so maybe he'll even have joined the Condor, perhaps via some kind of fast fighter/transport from the StormPetrel.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, like I said, Hardin is probably the best choice in terms of logistics and drama. He'd also be in touch because of our near-surrender, so I like having him on board the Condor...if that fits with your thinking.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have the set for EDF15 done soon--perhaps tomorrow night, or hopefully by Wednesday.&nbsp; I'll let you know, and if there's anything you want changed in order to streamline it with the movie, just tell me.<BR>
