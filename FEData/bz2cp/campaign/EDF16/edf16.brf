   Once the PEACEMAKER arrived with a fresh squadron of pilots, we headed into the tunnel. The Imperials knew we were coming, of course, but there was simply no other way to penetrate the ring of mountains surrounding the Wormhole Controller site. The PEACEMAKER would never make it up the steep slopes, and our dropships would have been shot down by the scores of missile batteries spiking the mountain peaks like the fangs of a dragon. Still, with two dozen tanks and heavy assault vehicles as escorts, I figured our trip through the tunnel would be a piece of cake.
   I figured wrong.
   The Imperials fought us tooth and claw for every inch of that tunnel--lacing the floor and walls with those damned antitank mines, skulking behind cover at every turn to stage deadly ambushes, and even flooding it with millions of liters of a corrosive acid that chewed through biometal like ocean waves dissolving a kid's sandcastle. Luckily, Eisenstein had the bright idea of blasting open a side wall that opened into a ravine; the acid drained away before it could do any serious damage.
   The Imperials' next trick nearly ended my short military career, and my life along with it. They had taken a mini-nuke and cleverly gift-wrapped it in the steel casing of an air-circulator, remounting it in a puddle in a dark corner near the floor. My two best scouts passed it by without a second glance--I would have too, if my tank's headlights hadn't picked up the bright gleam of polished steel. It was a striking contrast to the corrosion and rust everywhere else in the tunnel.
   I called a halt and emergency retreat. We all headed back the way we had come, but it was too late for my scouts. They were vaporized along with a half-kilometer stretch of tunnel.
   Luckily, we were close enough to the surface to dig our way out. We had penetrated most of the mountain range; better yet, the Imperials probably assumed our force had perished in the explosion. 
   But the delay has cost us dearly. Intel reports that the Imperial fleet is poised near the Wormhole, ready to depart. It's hard to imagine that we can reach the Controller and disable it in time. 
   But we have to try. The price of our failure could be Earth itself.
