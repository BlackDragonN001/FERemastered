Hey, map maker, where are my paths man?!
Seriously?! I have to randomize my base?
What's a CPU gotta do to get some paths around here?
No base paths? Sure...
It was silly of me to expect any paths.
Don't blame me if my base looks bad.
I'm sensing some laziness.
If you're expecting well-placed buildings, don't.
What's the key combination for self-destruction?
