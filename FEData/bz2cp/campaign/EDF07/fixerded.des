PERSONAL LOG: Pvt. Corbin, EDF

I blew it.  The builder that could have rebuilt the bridge for our attack on the Cerberi base has been destroyed.  Without it, we have no chance of rescuing Schultz.  My best friend has been tortured and brainwashed. Our scouts have discovered that he was taken off-planet to serve in the Hadean slave mines, and it's all my fault.  Almost as bad, our first tentative contact with the rebel Hadean Crown Prince has ended in embarrassing failure.

Wyndt-Essex has stripped me of my officer's rank and assigned me to the Scavenger Corps, and I can't blame her.  If I live through this, I'm quitting the EDF--but I'll never be able to forget how I let Schultz down.
