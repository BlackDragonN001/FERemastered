Tyranosaurus Rex:

One of the largest land predators 
of all time, growing up to 14 M in
length and weighing up to 7 tonnes.

T-Rex lived during the last 2 million
years of the Cretaceous period, right 
at the very end of the age of dinosaurs.

T-Rex was probably both a scavenger and
a hunter, studies of T-Rex remains seem
to indicate that this animal was a very 
fast mover considering it's enormous 
size.
