     I haven't slept in two days. We've been on the run every since the attack on the power station. At least our Cerberi disguises worked: the Hadeans have deactivated or destroyed all Cerberi vehicles in the region. But then again, they certainly haven't forgotten about us either. The Imperials are hot on our trail; they might as well have installed a homing beacon aboard the VENGEANCE. We've had to move and redeploy four times in the past twelve hours alone. 
     Colonel Stewart claims that the Hadean rebels are causing our problems, that General Thanatos himself is leading the Imperials to us. Ever since the INDEPENDENCE disaster, anger and guilt have clearly haunted Stewart--and crippled his judgment. I suspect he may even have tortured some of our Hadean prisoners.
     On the other hand, Schultz has hardly changed a bit. Captain Eisenstein is the latest unlucky target of Schultz's practical jokes. This morning, he uploaded a sexy blonde's persona into the ready room's Tru-Life databank, so now every time Hardin sends us a message, his voice comes out of a pin-up girl's mouth. Schultz is already starting on his next prank: I caught him tinkering with Eisenstein's radio this morning. I asked him if he wasn't scared of getting court-martialed, and Schultz said he's not afraid of anything any more--not after what the Cerberi did to him.
