BEAMS

Config name : beamfence

Set 'team' to 2 and place the mines around the desired area.

Notes: This is just a simple beam triggered in intervals. It's intended for a 'beamfence',
but I don't have any meshes for it yet. If you want it to fire horizontally, place the mine
on a vertical terrain - it fires perpendicular to the ground.
