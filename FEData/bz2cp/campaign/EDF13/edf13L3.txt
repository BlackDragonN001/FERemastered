The good news is that you managed to incapacitate the Hadeans' command and control systems, delaying their invasion plans for several days.

The bad news is that your entire task force is dead.  

When you ordered the VENGEANCE to deploy, her deep-drilling anchor bolts weakened an already unstable cave system. The resulting collapse left you all buried alive, fighting for air and slowly suffocating inside your vehicles and buildings. 

Centuries later, archaologists will find your remains and mount them in a museum dedicated to the history of Hadean military conquest.  By a stroke of bad luck, your mangled skeleton happens to be mounted beside the mummified remains of Major Wyndt-Essex, discovered in a Miasma tar-pit.  Rude Hadean schoolboys will make faces at you through the glass and joke about what a beautiful couple you make.
