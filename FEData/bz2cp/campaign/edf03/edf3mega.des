The Megapower unit was destroyed because of your negligence and incompetence. Without the Megapower, we now have no means of subverting the Hadean defenses here on Spartacus, or battling the other Megaguns in Labyrinth System. The StormPetrel cannot possibly run the gauntlet of Megaguns here now. General Hardin has reluctantly headed back to Earth to attempt to raise our planet's defenses, but the situation is bleak. And of course, we have no hope of being rescued before we succumb to hunger and thirst or the misery of arsenic poisoning.
