EDF09: "ESCAPE PATH"
INSTALLATION OF VO'S/BRIEFINGS/DESCRIPTIONS/OBJECTIVES:

1)  Unzip all files into the EDF09 subdirectory (should be under FEBETA-CAMPAIGN).

2)  Copy or move MISSIONS.ODF out to the FEBETA directory, overwriting the existing MISSIONS.ODF file.  This is necessary in order to get the voicemails, loadscreen VO, and briefing screens to work properly within the game shell.

3)  Copy or move EDF09.DLL and EDF09.BZS out to the BATTLEZONE2--MISSIONS directory, overwriting the existing DLL and BZS files.

4)  You're done!  Play the mission and let Zeeder know what you think, and pass along any comments about the briefings, objective windows, and VO's to me (Black Manatee).  Have fun!
