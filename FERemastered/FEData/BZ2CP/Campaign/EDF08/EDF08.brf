     The unit's outlook has steadily improved since you relieved Wyndt-Essex and took command. Better yet, morale skyrocketed with news that the StormPetrel will soon be orbiting Miasma. Looking forward to their imminent rescue, the officers and crews are doing everything possible to ensure the safety of the StormPetrel and her dropships. Cerberi attacks have tapered to a trickle since you decimated their Proteus complex, but you're playing it safe and moving the VENGEANCE every night in order to avoid surprises.
     Half the missile turrets in this sector have already been wiped out, but a snag has developed. During the night, scouts stumbled on an incredibly powerful missile turret that seemed virtually indestructible. Major Wyndt-Essex scoffed at the report, and she has promised to lead a whole squadron of tanks in a frontal attack on the turret this morning. 
     As angry as she is about losing her command to you, the pilots are joking that she could probably demolish the turret with her bare hands. Windex has questioned your leadership at every turn, couching her negative comments in the guise of respectful suggestions. 
     More than anyone else on Miasma, you are looking forward to the arrival of the StormPetrel--and the departure of Major Carla Wyndt-Essex.
