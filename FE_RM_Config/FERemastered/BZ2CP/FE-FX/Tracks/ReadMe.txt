TREAD TRACKS

Config name : ivatankt

Notes: Here's a demo of the tread tracks... With some better textures they would look nicer,
but I don't know how usable this would be ingame anyway - For one, they cause a framerate drop
whenever you come close, and secondly the more vehicles you have using them, the more the tracks and
smoke get clipped by the game. Too bad - would have been a nice effect!
