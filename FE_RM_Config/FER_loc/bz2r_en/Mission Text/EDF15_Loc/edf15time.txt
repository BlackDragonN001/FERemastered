RE:  Court of Inquiry
Verification code:  03782-281.jH3


This communication represents official notice of a court-martial to be held immediately upon your return to the StormPetrel (EDF-77). The charges and specifications for this procedure include but are not limited to:

1) Dereliction of duty for your failure to follow a direct order.

2) Cowardice in the face of the enemy, as demonstrated by your failure to scout the tunnel entrance on Facility.

3) Gross Insubordination, and Conduct Unbecoming an Officer, as evinced by your shouted accusations--before witnesses--that Colonel Stewart was a "silly ass" and a "chucklehead" for his decision to relieve you of duty.


If found guilty, the recommended sentences include but are not limited to:

1) Immediate separation from EDF, without pay, benefits, or other rights and privileges commensurate with rank (Dishonorable Discharge),

	AND

2) Death by slow atmospheric starvation (Braddock's "Vacuum Chamber Evacuation" methodology).


A Judge Advocate General will be assigned to your case upon your return to the StormPetrel.  It is recommended that you take advantage of your confinement to catch up on your paperwork.  Due to the seriousness of these charges and the overwhelming likelihood of conviction, a modified Last Will and Testament (Form LWT-32m) is enclosed for your convenience. 

Effective immediately, you are confined to quarters.
