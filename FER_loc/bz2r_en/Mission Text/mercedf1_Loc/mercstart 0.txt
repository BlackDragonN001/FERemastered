RE:  	Reassignment orders
Verification code:  2037VJQ.602R


Fellow GUARD DOG volunteers,

At General Hardin's request, I have prepared a detailed briefing to bring you up to speed on our mission and the reasons for the secrecy of this deployment.  Many of you are returning from extended tours with little access to newschannels, while others may have heard misleading rumors about our upcoming mission.

First off, let me set the record straight once and for all: we are NOT going to war with the Scions.  Far from it.

Despite the mistrust and suspicion prevalent since Armand Braddock's near-genocidal attack on the planet Core, the Scions have re-opened communication with Earth. In the interests of improved Human-Scion relations, our unit has been tasked to provide any necessary assistance. But Project GUARD DOG is far more than a cooperative gesture or mission of mercy. If Scion reports are to be believed, Earth herself may soon be threatened by the same mysterious attackers who have dealt such devastating blows to the Scions.

In short, if we fail to help our neighbors, we may be the next victims.

General Hardin has asked me to review the historical context of our current situation, in order to convey the nature and objectives of Project GUARD DOG. This document is only a summary; further details are available on the following page.

I.  NIGHT OF INFAMY: THE CORE DISASTER {12.23.2004}
	Over twenty years have passed since Armand Braddock's treacherous attack on the Scion planet of Core, yet the full truth remains clouded by a fog of media sensationalism, political finger-pointing, and wild conspiracy theories. Thankfully, the Alvarez Commission's report was finally completed last month and offers a comprehensive analysis of the tragedy. The enclosed interview of LCDR Lawrence Mason (DOC2381045) offers an eyewitness account of the disaster.
	As the Alvarez Commission points out, Human-Scion relations had thawed considerably during the four years after the Peace of Kossieh was signed (2000 - 2004). The Scion colony thrived on the newly-transformed Core, and both humans and Scions were reaping an immeasurable "peace dividend" as trade and cultural exchange revitalized our planets. 
	Braddock's treacherous attack was launched just one week after Scion and human leaders signed the Mutual Defense Treaty to protect our solar system from alien invasion. We little realized that the greatest danger was lurking on a moon of Pluto.  Exactly four years after our combined forces decimated Braddock's traitorous army on Rend, two massive salvos of biometal-tipped IPBMs (interplanetary ballistic missiles) were silently launched from an automated base on Charon (12.23.2004). 
	Captain Mason was in a survey ship orbiting Core, so he spotted the missiles first. His warning enabled the Scions to raise a planet-wide shield just before the first detonation, but the shield was quickly overwhelmed by over one thousand biometal nukes. The total yield is estimated to have exceeded seven hundred trillion gigatons, an amount similar to that released by the sun over a comparable period of time. The radiation pulse incinerated a wide swath of the Shabayev Asteroid Belt, rocked Core itself into an elliptical orbit, and eventually reached Earth in a flash that turned night into day and damaged part of our planet's ionosphere.
	The Scions' shield enabled most of the colonists to evacuate, fleeing our solar system through the wormhole stretching to their colony on Mire. During the missile attack, a message recorded by the long-dead Braddock was beamed to humans and Scions on all hyperwave frequencies. Braddock's statement claimed that he was doing his duty in "ransoming humanity's future from the polluting influence of mutant humans, wretched creatures which could never hope to understand our superior race."
	Not surprisingly, diplomatic overtures from humans to Scions have received a chilly reception. Proposals to reopen lines of communication, public apologies for the atrocity, and even offers for reparation and restitution have all been rebuffed.
	Earth has had precious little contact with the Scions in the decades since the Night of Infamy. Given this fact and the understandable enmity of the Scions, their recent plea for assistance is all the more striking and urgent.

II.  THE HADEAN THREAT: LOG OF THE ARK II {10.28.2006 to present (02.29.2024)}	
	Although most of Core's settlers escaped Braddock's devastating attack, they found little comfort upon reaching their home planets. The Scions depend heavily on biometal to survive, and countless millions of tons  were used to transform Core into habitability. The sudden influx of returning colonists only heightened the shortage of natural resources. In response, the Scion government commissioned a massive research and colonization project centered on construction of an interstellar transport ship, the Ark II.  
	Two years after the refugees arrived from Core (10.28.2006), the behemoth transport Ark II was launched. Its course took it through two successive wormholes leading toward the center of the galaxy. The Scions believed they were retracing the course followed by ancient Cthonians when they spread outward to colonize our worlds. Better yet, astronomical measurements pointed to high concentrations of biometal in the targeted areas. Nearly three years later (09.07.2009), the Ark II emerged from the second wormhole.
	The colonists were shocked to discover that the wormhole led directly to the homeworld of the legendary Cthonians. The civilization was very much alive, and even more aggressive and warlike than historians had imagined.  The two Cthonian races--Hadeans and Olympians--were engaged in an eons-long interplanetary civil war. On emerging from the wormhole, the Ark II immediately came under attack by forces of the Hadean Crown. 
	Luckily, the colonists were saved by the quick intervention of the more peaceful Olympians, who led the massive Ark II into hiding among the rocks and dust of a nearby asteroid field.  Two months passed before the Scions could effect critical repairs to their living spaces which had been damaged during the battle. The Olympians provided much-needed assistance while offering priceless insights about Cthonian culture and history, as well as a deeper understanding of biometallurgy.  
	The colonists also gained crucial information about their new enemy.  Intelligence collected from Olympian agents and a Scion spy satellite indicated that the militant Hadeans had recently made a quantum leap in transportation technology. Using the latest biometallurgical techniques, Hadean Crown forces had perfected a StarPortal which could fold space-time in order to send ships across continents, solar systems, or even galaxies with nearly-instantaneous speed.
	It wasn't until they powered up the engines that the colonists discovered a disastrous problem. The Ark II's WORMdrive, which allows the ship to penetrate cosmic wormholes, was damaged beyond the possibility of repair. Even the Olympians could not provide the critical components.
	At a horrific cost in both Scion and Olympian lives, the colonists seized the StarPortal and sent the Ark II through, destroying the portal behind them. They emerged on the other side in a bewildering "hub" world, a labyrinthine planet with literally dozens of StarPortals leading to every corner of the galaxy.
	The Hadeans' aim was clear: once the Olympians were crushed, they would use the StarPortal system to build a vast empire of conquered planets.  Even more horrifying was list of primary targets, gleaned from a Hadean datalink seized during the escape from Cthonia:
	According to the translated database, Earth and Mire have enormous strategic value to the Hadeans because each system straddles a critical space-time nexus, a bridge to nearby galaxies. Equally significant, the Hadeans feel threatened by humans and Scions who, along with the Olympians, represent the only three civilizations in our galaxy which have mastered the use of biometal. 
	The Hadean strategy calls for "complete extermination of Olympian, human, and Scion species, clearing the way for unrestrained domination of all remaining habitable worlds in this galaxy."
	Once on Labyrinth, the Scions found a StarPortal which led to our system, exiting just outside the orbit of Pluto.  They brought the Ark II through in order to deliver their warning and recruit Earth's help in halting the Hadean offensive.  The Ark II has continued on to Mire in order to warn the Scion defensive forces.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS:
	Unfortunately, EDF high command has placed little trust in the Scion report.  In a reluctant show of diplomacy, they have assigned General Hardin to lead the reconnaissance force to the alleged location of the StarPortal near Pluto, but the Joint Chiefs have repeatedly denied his requests to pass through the StarPortal.  Likewise, because of continued repercussions following the Biometal Riots of 2004 (see Jameson's MERCURY briefing), use of advanced armaments including biometal weaponry has been prohibited from this mission.
	However, General Hardin has complete faith in the Scions' warning; as a young AAN lieutenant, he served beside the Ark II's Captain Toris during the Battle of Rend.  For this reason, we will be making a slight detour to Mercury before continuing on to the StarPortal. There is also a possibility that navigational mishaps may occur once we reach the Portal itself; some ships may inadvertently pass through to the other side.
	The General requires every soldier to understand the facts behind Project GUARD DOG and to do his/her duty as he/she sees fit.  If any volunteers wish to withdraw from the mission, they should see me in private and a transfer will be arranged.  No official record will be made of your withdrawal, and all data regarding this assignment will be expunged from your personnel jacket.
