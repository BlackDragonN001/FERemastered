HISTORICAL TIMELINE: PAX KOSSIEH TO PRESENT

12.23.2000. . . . . 
*****Scions and humans sign treaty ending all interspecies conflicts between the two civilizations (Pax Kossieh). 
*****Scion sovereignty on Core is guaranteed as part of the pact.
*****Former General Armand Braddock's body is discovered in a ruined Attila on the battlefield of Rend. In response to a Scion request, his remains are dumped into a lava pool and incinerated.
*****Third Alchemitor on Rend is activated.

12.27.2000. . . . .
*****Alchemitors are synchronized and reach full power. Wormholes to Core are opened from the three source planets. Alchemitation of Core begins.

01.01.2001. . . . .
*****Alchemitation of Core is complete. The planet is now self-sufficient, producing the energy flux necessary to sustain Scion life.

03.05.2001. . . . .
*****First Scion trading vessel enters Earth orbit, with a cargo of biometal sculptures sent as gifts to the twelve human representatives to the AAN. A thirteenth sculpture, LoViray's famous "BROTHERHOOD" is sent to the AAN/United Nations as a gift to the families who lost relatives in the war. The forty-foot-tall mass of gleaming luminescence is erected outside the headquarters building.

03.05.2001 to 12.23.2004. . . . .
*****So-called "Golden Age" of interplanetary trade. The economies of Earth and Core steadily intertwine as the effects of peace and expanding markets launch an era of unprecedented prosperity. 
*****Biometallic automation and manufacturing techniques lead to increasing economy and affordability of both necessities and luxuries.
*****The World Stock Exchange and the Solar Technical Market both reach record high levels in 2004, peaking at values twice as high as anything witnessed before the Pax Kossieh was signed.

12.23.2004. . . . .
*****The Night of Infamy. Despite Armand Braddock's death, a secret base on Pluto has been producing dozens of biometal-tipped nuclear missiles every month since the Pax Kossieh was signed. In the absence of a counter-order from Braddock, the missiles are launched at Core. 
*****A recording Braddock made shortly before his death is broadcast via hyperwave to Core and Earth just as the first missiles strike. Braddock labels himself the "savior of humanity" and claims that the "verminous Scions must be destroyed" before they wipe out human civilization forever.
*****Core shield defenses are raised and the planet is evacuated. The last dozen transports are destroyed when the shield finally falters under the bombardment.
*****The ISDF is ordered to send its Seventh Fleet to aid in the defense and evacuation, though the units are too far away to provide immediate assistance.

12.24.2004. . . . .
*****The energy pulse caused by Braddock's attack is propagated throughout the solar system at the speed of light. Much of the Shabayev Asteroid Belt is pulverized, and Core is rocked on its axis while its solar orbit is flattened to an ellipse. Hours later, the radiation wave reaches earth in a flash that turns night into day and causes widespread power outages and communication breakdowns. Earth's ionosphere is damaged by the sudden dissipation of energy.

12.25.2004. . . . .
*****The ISDF's Seventh Fleet enters Core orbit. The planet is a charred, smoking ruin, though radiation counts are surprisingly low, an apparent result of the biometal-plutonium interaction. Exploratory patrols are sent to the surface, but no living Scions are found.

12.27.2004. . . .
*****The Scions report that THE CORE COMPUTER is missing after auto-ejecting from the remains of the Core planet.  This valuable computer was designed to leave the planet in an escape pod in the event of an emergency, and  to broadcast a tracking beacon.  The Scions lost contact with the beacon shortly after the incident.

12.29.2004 - 01.04.2005. . . . .
*****The so-called "Biometal Riots" are ignited in response to rumors of an ISDF role in the Core disaster. The origin of the rumors is never confirmed, though some members of the military suspect Pierre D'Arvignon, French ambassador to the United Nations, of starting or propagating the story in order to further his political career.

01.08.2005. . . . .
*****Led by Ambassador D'Arvignon, the UN Security Council officially disbands the ISDF, replacing it with the far smaller Earth Defense Force, whose mission is confined to protecting interplanetary trade routes from piracy. A "Biometal Safety Clause" forms part of the legislation, severely restricting the storage and use of biometal.

10.28.2006. . . . .
*****The Scion interstellar colony ship ARK II is launched from the Scion Homeworlds. The vessel carries a large proportion of refugees from Core who were displaced by Braddock's missile attack.

09.11.2009. . . . .
*****Ark II reaches the Cthonian system, home to the legendary race which supposedly colonized Earth eons ago. The colonists are astounded to discover that the Cthonians are very much alive, and just as ferociously aggressive as historians suspected. The Ark II comes under attack by ships from the Hadean Crown faction. Only intervention by the Hadeans' sworn enemies, the Olympians, saves the colonists from capture or death.

09.12.2009 - 10.30.2009. . . . .
*****Hiding in a remote asteroid field, the Scions attempt to repair the Ark II but discover that the ship's wormhole penetration engine is damaged beyond repair. The colonists also learn that their Hadean enemies have perfected a new StarPortal technology which allows instantaneous transport to almost any point in the galaxy, without the necessity of wormholes. Worse yet, the Hadeans are apparently planning a massive attack aimed at subjugating the intelligent races in the galaxy.

10.31.2009. . . . .
*****Aided by the Olympians, the Ark II escapes through a StarPortal in order to deliver a warning to both Scions and humans. They are unable to directly reach their Homeworlds, emerging instead in a "hub" star-system featuring numerous Hadean StarPortals offering access to various points in the galaxy.

11.03.2009 - 11.12.2009. . . . .
*****Patrolling near the planet "Labyrinth," the Scion colonists manage to capture a Hadean data-pod. Careful translation seems to indicate that the Hadeans are indeed planning a massive conquest of the galaxy. Central to their agenda is the control of both Earth and Mire, which supposedly lie adjacent to critical "space-time nexuses" which permit access to other galaxies.  Worse yet, the Hadeans have apparently been spying on humans and Scions for decades, and are concerned about our skill with biometal.
*****For all of these reasons, the Hadeans are expected to begin their campaigns with attacks on Earth and Mire.
*****The colonists use the datapod to discover a StarPortal leading to our solar system. Further clashes with stronger Hadean patrols force the Ark II to escape through that StarPortal, temporarily disabling it with satchel charges as they pass through.

11.13.2009. . . . .
*****Ark II enters our solar system by exiting the StarPortal just beyond Pluto. The colonists immediately contact Earth's government to convey their warning. At present, they are exploring the caves of Core in the hope of finding the parts necessary to repair their WORMdrive. If they succeed, they will cross through the old Core-Mire wormhole and carry their warning on to the Scion Homeworlds.

11.25.2009. . . . .
*****Edinshaw Toris, Master and Commander of the Ark II, testifies before the UN Security Council and EDF High Command. His warning largely falls on deaf ears; despite copious documentation, human officials are reluctant to put much faith in his words.  Still, they agree to shift the main EDF fleet toward the vicinity of the Hadean StarPortal exit. General Miles Hardin is authorized to form a small force (Project GUARD DOG) to assist the Scions in continuing their journey home and delivering their warning.

11.27.2009 (today). . . . .
*****Project GUARD DOG launches its carrier on its initial leg of the journey. The recruits will head to Mercury for a quick training mission before continuing on to Core.
