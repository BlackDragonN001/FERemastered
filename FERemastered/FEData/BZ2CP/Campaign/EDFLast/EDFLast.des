  We've tracked one of the
Imperial StarDestroyers to Earth
itself. The Emperor's forces have
built an Imperial base in Siberia,
where they seem to be searching
for the ancient Tartarus IV base
and the weapons hidden there.
   You must stop them before the
Emperor seizes the technology and
gains a decisive advantage in his
stalemated space-battle against
the allied EDF and Rebel fleets.
