Our life-support systems were aboard the dropships that were blasted by the Megagun and crashed. The food-synthesis units and water purification plant were damaged beyond repair.

Our quartermaster's report paints a grim picture: we have just two more days of food at half-rations. Even worse, our portable water purifiers have worn out due to high levels of arsenic in the water on Spartacus. It is imperative that we clear the way for the StormPetrel's arrival.

Replay of data tapes from our arrival has indicated the presence of at least three Megaguns in the Labyrinth system, only one of which is here on Spartacus. Luckily, the Scions' wormhole exit is very near this planet. If we can take out the Spartacus Megagun, the StormPetrel should be able to take shelter behind one of the planet's moons before the other Megaguns can destroy her. 

Major Wyndt-Essex is leading a feint attack against a large Hadean settlement several hundred klicks away. Under Col. Stewart's direction, your mission is to set up a base and search for a means to penetrate the Megagun's defenses. Further orders will be provided once you have a clear picture of the situation.  Good luck.
