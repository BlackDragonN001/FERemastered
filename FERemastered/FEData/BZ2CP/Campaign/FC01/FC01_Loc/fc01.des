   You have traveled with General
Thanatos and his rebels as they
passed through the wormhole to
its exit near Ruined Core.
   EDF and Imperial/Cerberi forces
are engaged in a fierce space-
battle, but our rebel ship is too
lightly armed to join the fray.
Instead, Thanatos and his rebels
will target the Imperial supply
lines originating on the surface
of Cerberi-controlled Core.
