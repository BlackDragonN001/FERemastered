  We have pinned the Cerberi in
their main base, yet they still
grow more powerful. An endless
supply of reinforcements are
being sent from Miasma via the
completed Transporter, while all
captured Hadeans and Scions are
sent to the Cerberizer vats.
  You must lead a final desperate
attack the enemy stronghold. 
Destroy the Transporter and the
Cerberizer vats, or die trying.
