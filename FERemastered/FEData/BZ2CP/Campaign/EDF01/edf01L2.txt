Your first command has ended in dismal failure. Worse yet, we have just learned that General Hardin had overruled his staff's concerns in order to lead Team Alpha on this mission. Like the rest of us, the General did not foresee the overwhelming attack by hostile forces--nor could he have predicted your utter inability to lead a simple rescue mission.  

Without General Hardin, we cannot continue. The StormPetrel will return home to prepare for the Hadean onslaught.
