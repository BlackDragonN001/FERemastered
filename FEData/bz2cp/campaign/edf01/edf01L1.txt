With just one Sabre left, you have no chance to overcome the formidable Hadean presence in the area. Your mission has ended in failure, but there is even worse news: General Hardin was leading Team Alpha despite the objections of his aides. He sustained a concussion during the crash, and we have just discovered that he has been captured by the Hadeans. 

Aside from the tragic loss to our side, the General represents a treasure trove of information for our enemies. The Scion colonists report that the Hadeans are enthusiastic experts at the fine art of slow torture.

Major Wyndt-Essex had strongly advised against your leading this mission, claiming that you were hopelessly incapable. She was obviously correct. It's too bad the General is paying for your incompetence with his life.
