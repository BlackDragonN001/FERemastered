In a shocking display of cowardice, you retreated from the battlefield before Major Wyndt-Essex and the PEACEMAKER Recycler were safe. You ran straight over one of the heavy trip-mines and your tank was blasted to dust.

The EDF is providing you with the best medical care that money can buy. Once your surgeries, treatments, and rehabilitation are complete, you will be court-martialed on charges of cowardice and publicly executed as a cautionary example to other would-be cowards in the Force.
