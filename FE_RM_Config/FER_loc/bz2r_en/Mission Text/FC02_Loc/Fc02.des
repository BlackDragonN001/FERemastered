   We have dominated the Cerberi
in battle, but they replace each
ship lost with two more. We must
destroy the 'Assembler,' this
area's Cerberi production plant.
   But we lack the firepower to
penetrate the Assembler's shield.
General Thanatos hopes to enlist
the Scion vessel "Ark II" for help.
Protect any visiting Scions, then
lead an attack on the Assembler,
hopefully with Scion assistance.
