threeway

It is best to look at a already done 3way.
 The dll will place the player as all  races.
You will have to rename paths all in lowercase letters as shown. All paths must be used!!
Test your map!!. Be sure each base is built and paths are working.

Paths needed:

SCION                              EDF                                 HADEAN
recs = matriarch         rece = Recycler             rech = Procreator
dower                            servicebay                      hservicebay
antenna                       techcenter                     htechcenter
stronghold                   armory                               harmory
kiln                                  factory                              hfactory
spire1                             power1                             hpower1
spire2                             power2                             hpower2
spire3                             power3                             hpower3
hold1                             hold5                                 hold3
hold2                             hold6                                 hold4
                                        bunker                              hgtow1
                                        gtow1                               hbunker
                                         gtow2                                         spike1

optional but reccommended:
       In my map "3way" I labeled a pool in each base "hadeonpool", "scionpool", and "edfpool". The dll will remove a pool from the players base if labeled this way. This allows the computer teams to have an advantage of an extra pool in their base. Yes i misspelled hadean so you have to too:)
         also make sure the base is built so their are no obstacles in the factories way to prevent overbuilding or ships getting stuck. Experienced mapmakers know this i am sure.
