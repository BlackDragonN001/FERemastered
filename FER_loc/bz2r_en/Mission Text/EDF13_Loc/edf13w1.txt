Major Corber:

General Hardin and I both want to congratulate you and Captain Eisenstein on your outstanding work in the caves of Facility. The information you narrow-casted to us once you reached the surface is proving to be priceless.

Most of the files refer to an ancient base called 'Tartarus IV,' which the Hadeans believe is hidden somewhere in our solar system. The base was apparently a research facility, built thousands of years ago by the original star-faring Cthonians, ancestors to the Hadean race. Tartarus IV must be hidden on a planet or moon far distant from Earth, or we would have discovered it during our many explorations of near-space. Some of the captured documents refer to the moons of Jupiter--particularly Europa and Ganymede--but the precise connection is unclear.

According to legend, the Tartarus IV base contains a powerful weapon or ship called the 'Nexus.' This super-weapon was named after the legendary Hadean scientist who developed the Cthonians' most lethal and destructive weapons of their time. The Nexus was intended for use in the disastrous Fury Wars, but Tartarus IV fell before the weapon could be completed. Rather than letting it fall into enemy hands, the Hadean scientists hid the unfinished device somewhere near Tartarus, then destroyed their base and sacrificed their lives in a hopeless battle against the Furies.

The Emperor's scientists believe the Nexus will prove an unbeatable weapon that will provide the nucleus for an entire new system of firepower. At all costs, we must ensure that they never have a chance to use the Nexus against us or our allies.
