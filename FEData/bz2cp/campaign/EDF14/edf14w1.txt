My Dearest Aunt Katya--

     So much has happened since my last letter that I don't know where to begin. Our campaign is going well despite the incredible odds we face. We won an important victory today, a plan conceived by General Hardin and his counterpart, General #c#e#n#s#o#r#e#d#, of the #c#e#n#s#o#r#e#d# forces. We attacked an enemy base disguised as #c#e#n#s#o#r#e#d# and managed to fool the #c#e#n#s#o#r#e#d# into believing that their own allies had turned on them. Equally important, we crippled a major geothermal power facility that supplies juice to this entire sector; we should have a much easier time sneaking past the #c#e#n#s#o#r#e#d# defenses now.

     You'll also notice that I've risen to a Major's rank now. It's hard to get used to having Captains saluting me when just a few short months ago I was a lowly Second Lieutenant! The added responsibility is an even harder adjustment, as you once warned me. Now I know what you and Uncle John mean when you talk about the "loneliness of command."

    I've got to run; I'll write more later.  Say hi to Uncle John, and give my love to little Veronika!

All the best--

Joe (DermoPrint Signature Verified)
