RE:  	Reassignment orders
Verification code:  2037VJQ.602R


Fellow GUARD DOG volunteers,

At General Hardin's request, I have prepared a detailed briefing to bring you up to speed on our mission and the reasons for the secrecy of this deployment.  Many of you are returning from extended tours with little access to newschannels, while others may have heard misleading rumors about our upcoming mission.

First off, let me set the record straight once and for all: we are NOT going to war with the Scions.  Far from it.

Despite the mistrust and suspicion prevalent since Armand Braddock's near-genocidal attack on the planet Core, the Scions have re-opened communication with Earth. In the interests of improved Human-Scion relations, our unit has been tasked to provide any necessary assistance. But Project GUARD DOG is far more than a cooperative gesture or mission of mercy. If Scion reports are to be believed, Earth herself may soon be threatened by the same mysterious attackers who have dealt such devastating blows to the Scions.

In short, if we fail to help our neighbors, we may be the next victims.

General Hardin has asked me to review the historical context of our current situation, in order to convey the nature and objectives of Project GUARD DOG. This document is only a summary; further details are available on the following page.

I.  NIGHT OF INFAMY: THE CORE DISASTER {12.23.2004--PK4}

Nearly five years have passed since Armand Braddock's treacherous attack on the Scion planet of Core, yet the full truth remains clouded by a fog of media sensationalism, political finger-pointing, and wild conspiracy theories. Thankfully, the Alvarez Commission's report was finally completed last month and offers a comprehensive analysis of the tragedy. The enclosed interview of LCDR Lawrence Mason (DOC2381045) offers an eyewitness account of the disaster.

As the Alvarez Commission points out, Human-Scion relations had thawed considerably during the four years after the Peace of Kossieh was signed (2000 - 2004). The Scion colony thrived on the newly-transformed Core, and both humans and Scions were reaping an immeasurable "peace dividend" as trade and cultural exchange revitalized our planets. 

All this changed exactly four years after Braddock's death. Few would have dreamed that the dead general had left behind a means of wreaking his revenge upon the Scions. On December 23, 2004, two massive salvos of biometal-tipped IPBMs (interplanetary ballistic missiles) were launched from an automated base on Pluto's moon. 

Captain Lawrence Mason was in a survey ship orbiting Core, so he quickly spotted the missiles and delivered a warning. The Scions barely had time to raise a planet-wide shield just before the first detonation, but the shield was quickly overwhelmed by over one thousand biometal nukes. The total yield is estimated to have exceeded seven hundred trillion gigatons, an amount similar to the energy released by the sun in a similar time period. The radiation pulse incinerated a wide swath of the Shabayev Asteroid Belt, rocked Core into an elliptical orbit, and eventually reached Earth in a flash that turned night into day, destroyed comm satellites, and may have damaged our planet's ionosphere.

Most of the Scions managed to evacuate before their shield failed, departing our solar system through a wormhole stretching to their colony on Mire. During the missile attack, a message recorded by the long-dead Braddock was beamed to humans and Scions on all hyperwave frequencies. Braddock's statement claimed that he was doing his duty in "ransoming humanity's future from the polluting influence of mutant humans, wretched creatures which could never hope to understand our superior race."

Not surprisingly, diplomatic overtures from humans to Scions have received a chilly reception ever since. Proposals to reopen lines of communication, public apologies for the atrocity, and even offers for reparation and restitution have all been rebuffed.

Earth has had precious little contact with the Scions in the years since the Night of Infamy. Given this fact and the understandable enmity of the Scions, their recent plea for assistance is all the more striking and urgent.

II.  THE HADEAN THREAT: LOG OF THE ARK II {10.28.2006 to 11.13.2009}

Although most of Core's settlers escaped Braddock's devastating attack, they found little comfort upon reaching their home planets. The Scions depend heavily on biometal to survive, and billions of megatons were used to transform Core into habitability. The sudden influx of returning colonists only heightened the shortage of natural resources. In response, the Scion government commissioned a massive research and colonization project centered on construction of an interstellar transport ship, the Ark II. 

The behemoth transport was launched on 10.28.2006, two years after the refugees reached their Homeworlds from Core. The Ark II traveled through two wormholes in a journey that lasted almost three years. Upon emerging near the galactic center, the Ark came under attack by hostile scouts vessels. Eventually capital ships engaged the Ark, critically damaging its drive system.

Before the ship was captured, a second alien contact engaged the first vessels, destroying one ship and heavily damaging the second. The colonists discovered that they had emerged in the center of a hereditary war between two descendants of the ancient Cthonians. The more peaceful Olympians had rescued the colonists from the warlike Hadean Crown faction; the Olympians led their new allies to the safety of a nearby asteroid field.

Unfortunately, damage to the ship's WORMdrive could not be fully repaired. Without it, the Ark was apparently trapped in the Cthonian system, unable to travel through any existing wormhole. But the colonists soon discovered that the Hadeans had developed a technique for traveling through space-time without using wormholes. At a staggering price in both Hadean and Olympian lives and ships, the Ark II escaped through a Hadean StarPortal which the Olympians destroyed behind them.

The Ark emerged at an intermediary star system, a type of "hub" where the Hadeans had constructed many StarPortals for access to various points in the galaxy. The Scion colonists managed to capture a data-pod which provided them with critical information on the Hadeans' military plans and goals. The militant faction of the Cthonian race apparently plans to employ the StarPortals to build an empire of conquered planets. Their first two targets are Earth and Mire, which appear to be located near critical strategic points in space-time. The Hadeans also perceive humans and Scions as threats because of our expertise with biometal.

The Hadean plan calls for the "complete extermination of Olympian, human, and Scion species, clearing the way for unrestrained domination of all remaining habitable worlds in this galaxy, and potentially many other galaxies to come."

Fortunately, the captured data-pod controlled a StarPortal pointed toward our solar system.  The Ark II emerged safely from the Portal last week and Toris immediately contacted the EDF fleet with his warning.

At the present time, the Scion colonists are exploring the deep caves of Core in the hope of finding the necessary equipment to repair their WORMdrive. Once repairs are completed, they will continue on to Mire and the Homeworlds in order to deliver the warning.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS:

Unfortunately, EDF high command has placed little faith in the Scion report. In more of a diplomatic than military move, they have assigned General Hardin to lead a reconnaissance force to the alleged location of the StarPortal near Pluto, but the Joint Chiefs have repeatedly denied his requests to pass through the StarPortal. The main EDF fleet will remain on station near Core in order to report any Scion forces emerging from the original ruined wormhole.  

Because of continued repercussions following the Biometal Riots of 2004 (see RIOT INFO), use of advanced armaments including biometal weaponry has been prohibited from this mission. However, General Hardin has complete faith in the Scions' warning and is taking the threat very seriously.  For this reason, we will be making a slight detour to Mercury before continuing on to the StarPortal. There is also a possibility that navigational mishaps may occur once we reach the Portal itself; some ships may inadvertently pass through to the other side.

The General requires every soldier to understand the facts behind Project GUARD DOG and to do his/her duty as he/she sees fit.  If any volunteers wish to withdraw from the mission, they should see me in private and a transfer will be arranged.  No official record will be made of your withdrawal, and all data regarding this assignment will be expunged from your personnel jacket.
