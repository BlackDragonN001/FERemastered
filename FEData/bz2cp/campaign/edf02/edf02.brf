Wreckage from our attackers' tanks shows markings compatible with the units that attacked the Ark II. EDF Division Intel has confirmed that the hostiles on Spartacus are indeed Hadean Crown forces. Despite their relatively small numbers here on Spartacus, the Hadeans have erected a formidable planetary defense grid using radar-guided blaster missile towers. Our dropships are especially vulnerable to such attacks, so insertions will start from remote but safe locations.

General Hardin was quite impressed by your rescue of the crash victims yesterday. He has placed you in charge of a detachment sent to erect a base on our eastern flank. Major Wyndt-Essex objected strenuously, claiming that you were far too inexperienced and unreliable to be trusted with one of our few remaining Recyclers. Wyndt-Essex was overruled and assigned to lead a few scouts surveying potential locations for a backup base. 

Your secondary objective is to determine how the Hadeans are able to redeploy their forces so swiftly. Our analysts suspect the existence of a sophisticated transportation system. Colonel Stewart will be your Intel liaison aboard the StormPetrel; follow his advice carefully.
