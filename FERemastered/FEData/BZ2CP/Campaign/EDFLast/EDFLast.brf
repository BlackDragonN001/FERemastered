   Exiting the wormhole near the ruined planet of Core in our own solar system, we nearly stumbled into a huge space battle. Through the INTREPID's viewscreens, we could see all three of Earth's StarCarriers playing a desperate game of cat-and-mouse against the far larger and more powerful Hadean fleet. In a battle of mobility against sheer firepower, the StarCarriers launched swarms of nimble anti-G fighters against ponderous Imperial StarDestroyers bristling with plasma-beam cannons and antimatter torpedoes. Our pilots scored hit after hit, but their weapons hardly seemed to scratch the heavily shielded Imperial dreadnoughts.
   Luckily, General Thanatos entered the fray with a pair of rebel Star-Destroyers just as our StarCarriers started taking serious hits. The allied forces are nearly a match for the Hadean-Cerberi fleet, but the Cerberi have gained control of Core and are supplying the Emperor with a constant stream of robotic replacement troops and starfighters. 
   To our surprise, Eisenstein also discovered a powerful HyperWave signal emanating from deep beneath the surface of Core, and broadcast on the Cerberi wavelength. General Thanatos has dispatched a fleet of dropships to Core with two goals: harassing the Imperial supply lines, and searching for the mysterious intelligence that may be controlling the renegade black Cerberi both here and back in the Labyrinth system.
   We were preparing our own landing party to help with the Core invasion when INTREPID's SkyEye array made a shocking discovery: one of the Imperial StarDestroyers was missing from the space-battle. By studying the Imperial ion-drive trails, our techs discovered a telltale stream leading toward the inner planets--toward Earth itself. By swinging through Jupiter's gravity field, we've slingshotted INTREPID into high-speed pursuit. We're no match for the fifth StarDestroyer, but with our entire fleet battling the other Imperial ships, little INTREPID is Earth's last line of defense.
