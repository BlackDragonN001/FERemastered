Although we scored a major victory by smashing the Megaguns in Labyrinth System, the Hadeans are pouring an apparently endless supply of troops and equipment onto the planet. We have had to abandon the damaged Megagun and flee to the hills, but the Hadeans are not far behind. With control of the ground and the skies, our enemy has tracked us down and even now is tightening a noose around our hiding place.

Our only hope is an apparent StarPortal which lies about 40 kilometers distant. We'll need to fight our way through enemy lines in order to reach the site. Even then, it's quite possible that the StarPortal will be inoperative; our information comes from an old datacube found in an abandoned Hadean scavenger. 

The StarPortal may even be a Hadean ruse -- enticing bait meant to lure us into a final, hopeless trap. Even if the StarPortal is functional, we have no idea where it leads: perhaps to the Hadean homeworlds, perhaps to Earth, or maybe to some unfathomable world on the other side of the galaxy.

Still, we have no choice. The StarPortal represents our only shot at survival.
