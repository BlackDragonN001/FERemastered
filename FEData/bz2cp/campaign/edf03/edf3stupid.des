Your negligence to duty is exceeded only by your blundering incompetence. Because you failed to follow a simple order to place an explosive charge at the canyon blockage, our forces were caught with no means of retreat. A pincer attack by the Hadeans overwhelmed our defenses and claimed our Recycler. 

Our forces have scattered into the hills. With no food or water left and no hope of rescue by the StormPetrel, they won't last long.
