This new planet is literally a breath of fresh air: warm sun, sparkling waves lapping sandy beaches, and enough pure breathable air to wash Miasma's hellish stench from our lungs. 

But the heavenly atmosphere is a trap, a serpent-infested Garden of Eden. The diamond-bright beaches are studded with Xyr Guard Turrets, and Hadean Atlases prowl the meadows and palm forests. Even the ocean is deadly, teeming with Cerberi that ply the waves like hulking black water-spiders.

Worst of all is a new Hadean weapon apparently developed here on Tranquility. The "Finger of God" is a high-powered plasma beam fired from low-orbiting satellites, triggered by hidden proximity sensors. The ghastly device caught two of our pilots during a recon foray to the south, killing one pilot instantly and mortally wounding the other with horribly painful burns. A third pilot survived unscathed to tell of the new weapon: a bright yellow beam stabbing down from the sky without warning, instantly melting his wingmen's tanks to steaming puddles of liquid biometal.

Needless to say, we're all keeping our guards up despite Tranquility's seductive allure.
