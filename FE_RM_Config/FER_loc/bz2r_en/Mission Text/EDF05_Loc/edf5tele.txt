You did not wait for the Recycler to transport. It was attacked just as you entered the Portal.

Worse yet, a shot from the Hadeans destroyed the power supply while you were in the process of being transported. Without a Portal to focus your transfer, the atoms and molecules of your body were dematerialized into pure energy and never sent to the receiving Portal at your destination. In a textbook illustration of Einstein's classic equation, E=mc2, much of the energy was released in the form of a massive nuclear detonation which destroyed the Recycler and any tanks within a two-mile radius. Because biometal's atomic properties are similar to plutonium, the EDF and Hadean vehicles fed the nuclear chain reaction, resulting in a total yield of several million megatons.

The StormPetrel, orbiting high overhead, suffered a catastrophic systems failure due to the electromagnetic pulse emitted during the nuclear blast. Before her crew could regain control, her orbit decayed and she entered the dense Spartacus atmosphere, igniting in a brilliant techicolor fireball.

The Hadeans completed their StarPortal to our solar system just a few weeks later.  Earth was quickly subjugated and converted to a resort colony for vacationing Hadean sportsmen.  Less than six months after your catastrophic mistake, the last remnants of humanity were hunted to extinction. 

The Scion homeworlds soon followed suit, although most of the Scions were kept alive. The healthiest specimens have been brought to Earth, where they now roam the nature preserves and provide an excellent challenge to discriminating Hadean hunters.
