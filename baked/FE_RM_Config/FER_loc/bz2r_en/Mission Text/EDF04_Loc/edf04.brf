The next 24 hours will determine whether the StormPetrel safely enters the Labyrinth System or your task force is stranded here forever.

Although you've gained control of the MegaPower facility, you'll need to seize the Megagun in order to protect the StormPetrel. By firing on the other Megaguns in the system, you'll disable the interplanetary defense grid which wreaked such havoc on our first set of dropships.

Luckily, your supply situation has improved for now. The Recycler VENGEANCE just arrived from its hiding place on a Spartacus moon carrying a partial load of supplies and water filters--enough for another day or two. The VENGEANCE also supports production of advanced EDF weaponry, including the new Heavy Chain Gun, the Rocket Bomb, and a completely redesigned bomber known as the Hammer Destroyer.

There's only one hitch: the VENGEANCE also brought a replacement for Colonel Stewart. Major Wyndt-Essex is leading your task force once again, and she's determined to prove herself a better commander than Stewart ever was. In order to do that, she's willing to sacrifice every soldier in the task force . . . starting with you and Schultz.
