FC02_00a.wav: Voicemail #1 (Intercepted Cerberi Transmission):
"...experimental upgrade of Sector Four Assembler Plant, elevating output by two orders of magnitude while dramatically reducing biometal content. If successful, upgrades will be applied to all Assemblers on Core, Miasma, and Facility. Improved production rate will permit MotherGod to sterilize all nonmetallic infestations in an estimated four thousand six hundred kiloseconds from mark [BEEP!]. Other contingencies include..."

FC02_00b.wav: Voicemail #2 (General Thanatos):
"Our SciWizards have learned that the new technology could radically increase the Cerberi's production rate: the upgraded Assembler could produce eighty tanks as quickly as we can produce ONE, using only a quarter of the biometal content we require per vehicle...[pause]...This is an ominous development. Cerberi technology has already eclipsed our own, and the gap is growing quickly. We MUST destroy the Assembler and then attack their so-called 'MotherGod' before the Cerberi overwhelm us with sheer numbers."

FC02_00c.wav: Voicemail #3 (Padishah LeBlanc: Scion Admiral Commanding Ark II):
"Colonel Corber, my landing party will arrive shortly. Luckily, a few of our old orbiting teleporters are still functional, and one of the stations is quite near your base. My landing party can thus reach the surface without the aid of a dropship. We will contact your base for an escort upon our arrival."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
LOFC02.wav:  Corber:
"We had won every battle, but we were losing the war. Our enemy was multiplying like the heads of a hydra: each Cerberi vessel we destroyed was replaced by two or three more. Worst of all, the Cerberi had developed a new manufacturing process that threatened to drown us in a tidal wave of robotic forces. We had to destroy the nearby Assembler, and then discover the nature of the mystical MotherGod here on Core. Our only hope was to find the original head of the Cerberi hydra--and chop it off at the roots."

fc02_01.wav:  General Thanatos:
"Talon Corber, this is a suitable area to deploy the Procreator. I will leave the base and its defense in your capable hands, while I make preparations to receive Admiral LeBlanc."

fc02_02.wav:  SciWizard Kranios:
"Talon Corber, the Scion representatives have sent a coded message informing us that their transport just reached the orbiting teleporter unit. Their receiving unit is located somewhere north of our base. Because of heavy Cerberi activity in that area, Slasher/Prime Thanatos recommends that you prepare a powerful group of vessels to escort the convoy to base."

fc02_03.wav:   General Thanatos:
"Talon Corber, the Scion admiral and his party have just traveled through the orbital teleporter. Your SciWizard has highlighted their location on your display. Unfortunately, they have landed near a major Cerberi patrol route, so they will not remain undiscovered for long. Hurry to their location and escort them back to base." 

fc02_03a.wav:   Padishah (Admiral) LeBlanc, Captain Holmes (Scion):
HOLMES: "Admiral, our escort doesn't appear to be coming."
LEBLANC: "Agreed, Captain Holmes. I see no cause to remain here, exposed and vulnerable--or to join forces with such unreliable allies. Order the men back to the TransPorter."
HOLMES: "Yes, sir."


fc02_03b.wav:   Padishah (Admiral) LeBlanc:
"Greetings, Colonel Corber. Your base has radioed us to convey a recommended approach route. We will follow it as requested...By the way, your vessel is quite remarkable. I look forward to meeting your Hadean allies and exploring their technology."

fc02_04.wav:  SciWizard Kranios, Admiral LeBlanc, Corber:
KRANIOS: "Admiral LeBlanc, the Cerberi have deployed an energy portal directly in your path! We have entered an alternate route into your vessel's guidance system."
LEBLANC (shaken but fascinated as well): "Remarkable! Can they create one of these portals anywhere they desire?"
CORBER: "They're limited to a few dozen kilometers right now, sir. But they are rumored to possess an interplanetary prototype."
KRANIOS: "They are also working on an interstellar version."
LEBLANC (worried): "I see...Quite a disturbing prospect indeed."

fc02_05.wav: Admiral LeBlanc:
"Colonel Corber, I have directed the Ark II into a distant orbit, well outside the range of the Cerberi planetary defenses. The Ark should be safe, but from that distance we'll need you to plant a targeting beacon on the Assembler. You must approach close enough to target the Assembler, then deploy the beacon as close to the structure as possible. You may have to repeat the process several times, because the Assembler is heavily shielded, but the beam will eventually get the job done."
