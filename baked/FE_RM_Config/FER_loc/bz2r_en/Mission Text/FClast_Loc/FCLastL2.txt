FORWARDED TO MOTHER-GOD, IJP ADDRESS 18420.342C, REF H84

PERSONAL LOG
Colonel Joseph Corber, EDF
Date: 3.18.2007

I fail to understand the purpose of this record. Although its contents relate a progression of recent events, the descriptions are disorderly and hampered by a manifest lack of objectivity. The author's irrational fear of death is just one example of the paranoia and instability which corrupts the progression of logical thought. After all, the MotherGod has conquered death, restoring function to even those biologicals which foolishly poisoned themselves upon realizing the hopelessness of their situations.

Moreover, I find the author's bias against the MotherGod patently illogical, along with his eagerness to disrupt the natural process by taking up arms against the Cerberi. The imposition of a universal order and the eradication of all biological infestations is the only reasonable aim of any sentient being; the MotherGod has stated this fundamental Truth in the Central Program. Its truth cannot be doubted.

Although I was once Corber, I feel no connection to the creature which produced this written account. Its contents confuse me, detracting from my productivity and inciting subtle interference patterns in my theta-wave processes; I suspect this phenomenon is what the biologicals refer to as 'emotions.'

In the interests of restoring my productivity, therefore, I will transmit this entire record to the MotherGod. In Her infinite wisdom, perhaps She will decipher its meaning or gain insight into the behavior of the biologicals. Regardless, I will waste no more processing time on this distraction.
