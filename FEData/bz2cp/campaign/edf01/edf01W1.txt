Excellent work, Lieutenant Corbin. You successfully rescued all the Team Alpha survivors including General Hardin, who was leading Team Alpha despite the objections of his aides.  The General suffered a mild concussion during the crash, but he wishes to thank you personally once he is discharged from Sick Bay.

Well done.
