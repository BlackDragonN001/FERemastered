METEOR SHOWER

Config name : meteor

Set 'team' to 2 and place a few mines around the desired area.

Notes: Try to place them on the level that your ships will travel on. If you place the mines on a hill
(too high) the fireball effect might not show (BZ2 seems to cut the visual fx when they are too far
away, or when they travel too fast, which is what happens when they fall from too high an altitude
and gain too much speed). If you place the mines too low (canyon, river bottom) the meteor trajectory
will not be straight enough, or you will see them appear out of 'nowhere'
The meteor cycle is about half a minute.
