ONE vs ONE
There is great flexibility in the way you approach making these maps.  The player could appear on one end and all the enemies at the opposite end. Or you could have each enemy appear at different places. As long as the bases are seperate!!


PATHS needed:

player = where the player recycler appears
patrol1 = where the cerberi gorgon will patrol the cerberi base

CERBERI:
cpower1
cpower2
cpower3
cfactory
cservicebay
cbunker
ctraining
ctechcenter
carmory
cgtow
cgtow2
cgtow3
hold7
hold8



MINELAYER:
  The cerberi will use the minelayer. The two paths needed are "mine1" and "mine2". The minelayer when built will mine ONE of these paths at random. So you could surround the base with one and a extractor with the other or any other strategy.  The mines used have extended life and can defend a good sized area. IMPORTANT: minelaying looks best on flat or near flat land:)
