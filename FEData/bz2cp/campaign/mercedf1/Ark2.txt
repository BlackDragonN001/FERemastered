10.27.2006: After two years of seemingly endless construction and preparation, our journey is ready to begin. It brings me great joy to see that over half of our colonists are survivors of the criminal Braddock’s heinous attack on Core. The monster may have stolen our world from us, but he could never take our spirit, or our hope.
Our Scion brothers and sisters have sacrificed much to help us find a new home. Biometal is scarce enough here in the Homeworlds, and our return from Core worsened the situation even further. Yet our comrades freely shared their limited resources with us, working feverishly and completing the Ark II a full two years ahead of schedule. 

We will be forever in their debt, but that is as it should be. As Padishah Burns once said, “To be a Scion is to be a brother or a sister to our entire race. For no matter how great our numbers, how many light-years apart our worlds, all Scions are part of one family."

Tomorrow we will set out for the stars, chart a course toward the center of the galaxy, and retrace the steps of the legendary Cthonians. Our quest for a biometal-rich planet may take us through many wormholes, past dozens of suns and millions of light-years. 

But no matter how far we travel, our hearts will remain here in the Homeworlds, with the rest of our family.

---------------------------------
{10.28.2006 - 08.17.2009: The log for this time period is mostly concerned with routine issues of navigation, statistics on performance of the WORMdrive, passage through the first wormhole, and exploration of nearby star systems. Unfortunately, none of the systems appear to have significant concentrations of biometal, so the colonists concentrate on searching for another wormhole. Three months pass before one is discovered.}
---------------------------------

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

08.18.2009:  After three months of searching, we have finally discovered a wormhole within reach of our ship. The entrance is three weeks away; we will slowly accelerate en route and hit the wormhole at the precise speed necessary for the WORMdrive to function. This will conserve precious matter for the hyperdrive, in case we need to search for a third wormhole. 

But our astronomers are more hopeful than ever before. The wormhole appears to be focused on a zone near edge of the galactic core, an area rich with elderly red dwarf stars, whose planets tend to be rich in biometal. Surveys also indicate that the wormhole entrance spans several light-hours, a size which promises a great travel distance.

With luck, this next jump will take us to our new home.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

09.08.2009:  We emerged from the wormhole late last night. Almost instantly, the Ark II came under attack by scattered wings of oddly-shaped vehicles. We have attempted to hail our attackers in order to communicate our peaceful intentions. But despite our use of numerous wavelengths and code-translation algorithms, the  hostiles take no effort to understand our messages. Several of our fighters have been destroyed in ship-to-ship combat, and the supply modules have taken devastating hits. Both the enemy fighters and their weapons have a frightening ability to travel from point to point instantaneously, as though they are accessing a number of hidden wormholes scattered throughout this quadrant of space. But no stars are nearby, and our astronomers can detect no obvious gaps in space-time that would indicate nearby wormholes.

I worry that these attacks merely represent an advance force of scouts, as we have yet to see any capital ships. We can hold our own against this group of fighters, but our defenses would be hopelessly outgunned by a destroyer or cruiser.

Our astronomers are frantically searching for a wormhole we can reach in time, before the main enemy force arrives.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

09:11:2009:  I have not slept in the past three days, nor have I had an opportunity to record my observations in the log. The bewildering string of events following my last entry are almost impossible for me to believe, though I have just experienced them. For anyone reading this log, it may very well seem like a complete fabrication, but I swear that all this is true.

Enemy capital ships arrived within twelve hours of the first fighter attacks...
---------------------------------
{Following this introduction, Toris describes the enemy destroyer and cruiser at some length; holo-renderings from the Ark’s cameras have been entered into our ship’s Combat DataLink.}
---------------------------------
...The cruiser was only half the size of the Ark II, and the destroyer was even smaller. But both vessels were clearly armed with a deadly array of weaponry. A single shot from the destroyer’s main battery blasted through the our dorsal shielding and incinerated one of the maneuvering engines, killing PodLeader Vincendi and wounding several sub-engineers.

The admiral in command of the cruiser finally opened a comm-channel, appearing in our holovid display and introducing himself as Admiral Horace Achilleon, commanding the Fifth Fleet of the Hadean Crown...
---------------------------------
(Toris describes the Hadean admiral in some detail (see attached holovid); based on the holorenderings, anthropologists have judged him to be basically humanoid with only minor racial-level variances.}
---------------------------------
...The admiral demanded our immediate and unconditional surrender. Though our situation seemed hopeless, I stalled for time and conferred with Padishah Marcinko for several minutes. I had just reopened the comm-link when a sudden burst of static severed our connection. Simultaneously, our viewscreens showed a burst of blue light from the region of the destroyer.

Fearing the worst, we braced for impact only to see the destroyer vanish in a ball of hot plasma. The cruiser’s shields glowed a sickly yellow-green before several explosions rippled across its starboard drive array. Seconds later, our comm-link crackled to life again and the holovid displayed a smiling male figure dressed much like the Hadean admiral though in a slightly different style and color...
---------------------------------
{The savior of the Ark II is a captain in the Olympian military, fighting the Hadeans in a war which has lasted for several millennia. His destroyer removes its cloaking shield in order to lead the damaged Ark to the safety of a nearby asteroid field.

The Olympian forces manage to hide the Ark for several weeks while the Scions attempt to repair their maneuvering engine. Toris learns that the Olympians and Hadeans are branches of the Cthonian race--bitter enemies engaged in a bloody interplanetary war whose original cause is hidden in the distant past. 

The millennia of fighting has gradually worn down the more peaceful Olympians while making the warlike Hadeans even more powerful. As the Olympians aid the colonists with repairs, they pass on priceless insights on Cthonian culture and history along with many advanced techniques for working with biometal.

The colonists also gained crucial information about their new enemy.  Intelligence collected from Olympian agents and a Scion spy satellite indicated that the militant Hadeans had recently made a quantum leap in transportation technology. Using the latest biometallurgical technology, Hadean Crown forces had perfected a StarPortal capable of folding space-time in order to send ships across continents, solar systems, or even galaxies with nearly-instantaneous speed-and without any need for a wormhole.

The potential consequences of this development were staggering. The Hadeans were bent on galactic domination, and now they had a perfect tool for subjugating other civilizations. A massive StarPortal had just been completed near the Hadean moon, and an armada of cruisers, destroyers, and assault transports was massing near the entrance.

The Scion colonists decided that the Homeworlds must be warned at any cost. Unfortunately, the massive blast from the Hadean destroyer had damaged more than just the maneuvering engine. A critical component in the Ark II’s WORMdrive had been damaged beyond repair. Although the Scions carried equipment to manufacture the delicate module, fabrication and calibration could take weeks or even months. 

There was only one other means of escaping the Cthonian system in time to deliver the warning. At a horrific cost in both Scion and Olympian lives, the colonists raced past the armada and through the StarPortal. With no means of programming the Portal, they could only hope to emerge somewhere near their home system. 

Instead, the Scions found themselves in a strange star system unique for the number of natural wormholes existing nearby. More disturbing was the discovery that the largest planet in the system--which they named Labyrinth--housed literally dozens of StarPortals which conceivably led to every corner of the galaxy.}

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

11.01.2009: A full day has passed since we emerged from the Hadean StarPortal, and we detect no sign of pursuit. The fact that no Hadeans have followed indicate that our allies have managed to destroy the StarPortal after we entered its gate. My heart grieves for the losses they must have endured: the Olympians have bought us precious time to reach home, doubtless at a frightening cost in ships and lives. When we passed through the Portal, our last glimpse was of a single Olympian frigate simultaneously battling four Hadean destroyers before disappearing in a blinding flash of light.

But I very much fear that the Olympians’ noble sacrifices may have been in vain. A random shot from a Hadean cruiser struck us just as we transited the Portal; the burst of energy followed us through space-time and struck just as we emerged. Our shields had not yet re-activated, and the impact blast devastated our fabrication pod. We can no longer manufacture the necessary component to repair our WORMdrive.

I fear that we are trapped.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

11.03.2009: Our hopes rose again today with the fortuitous discovery and capture of a Hadean data-node. Early this morning, we sent out three Scavengers to harvest biometal from the second moon of Labyrinth. Escorts on routine patrol found a lightly-armed Hadean outpost near the site of a StarPortal control pod. Acting on my orders, Sub-Leader Girard conducted a letter-perfect assault on the outpost, capturing it with no Scion casualties despite the presence of several automated chainguns surrounding the periphery of the base.

More importantly, our assault force managed to capture the data-node intact, defusing a self-destruct charge just seconds before it detonated. Our technicians are hard at work on translating the information.

Also to be commended for today’s operation are Sub-Leader Fletcher, along with his assistant...

---------------------------------
{At this point, Toris enumerates several other members of the assault team for commendation}

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

11.13.2009: The Hadean database has finally yielded its secrets, and we are both disturbed and elated by the information it contains. One key document, apparently circulated among all Hadean transportation units, spells out the Hadean battle plans and hopes for the future.

The Hadeans' aim is clear: once the Olympians are crushed, they will employ the StarPortals to build a vast empire of conquered planets.  Even more horrifying is the list of initial targets. According to the translated database, both Earth and Mire are each located near a critical space-time nexus, which can potentially create bridges to nearby galaxies. The Hadeans also seem to feel threatened by Scions and humans, whom they have observed for the past several decades as we mastered the use of biometal. The Hadean plan calls for the "complete extermination of Olympian, human, and Scion species, clearing the way for unrestrained domination of all remaining habitable worlds in this galaxy, and potentially many other galaxies to come."

But perhaps there is hope for us. The very StarPortal which we now control apparently provides access to Earth’s star system, exiting just outside the orbit of Pluto, the tenth planet in the system. Tomorrow we will send the Ark II through the StarPortal in the hope of spreading the warning to the humans on Earth. Equally important, we will explore the deep caves of Core in the hope of finding undamaged fabrication equipment to replace our damaged WORMdrive component. Once repairs are completed, we will access the wormhole leading from Core to Mire, then continue on to the Homeworlds to deliver the alarm.

But we cannot fight the Hadeans alone, and our Olympian allies are tottering on the brink of collapse. We can only hope that the humans on Earth believe our astonishing story and help us stem the incoming Hadean rip-tide.
