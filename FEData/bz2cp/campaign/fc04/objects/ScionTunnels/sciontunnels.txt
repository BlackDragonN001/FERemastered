The entire set of tunnels, large and small is included, with the odfs set for infinite health and no detection or signatures. The textures are reduced size for increased performance, with little resolution loss.

For ease of use they are named the same as conventional tunnels with an s appended to their name. You can select the conventional tunnel with the editor list then add the s to get the scion version.
